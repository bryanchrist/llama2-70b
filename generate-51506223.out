I found that you can access the number of responses in one of the questions but I want the same data as when I use the following syntax:

test_data = df.to_dict()

test_ans = test_data['python_task'][0]

print(test_ans == df['python_task'][0].iloc[0])
#prints True
\end{code}

Answer: I came up with the following solution, which I think is a bit ugly:

\begin{code}
q1_1 = test_data["python_task"][0].get("response")[0]
q1_2 = test_data["python_task"][1].get("response")[0]
...
