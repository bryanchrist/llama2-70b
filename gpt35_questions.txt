Topic: Power Rangers Question: The Power Rangers team is made up of 6 members. Each member has a different colored suit. The team needs to prepare for battle by creating 3 groups of 2 members each. How many different possible combinations of groups can they create?

Solution:
def solution():
    #There are 6 members in the Power Rangers team
    members = 6
    #They need to form 3 groups of 2 members each
    group_size = 2
    num_groups = 3

    result = math.comb(members, group_size) * math.comb(members - group_size, group_size) * math.comb(members - 2*group_size, group_size)
    return result

Explanation:
To calculate the number of possible combinations, we can use the formula for combinations: n choose r, which is equal to n! / (r! * (n-r)!).
For the first group, we have 6 members to choose from, and we need to choose 2. This gives us 6 choose 2: 6! / (2! * 4!) = 15.
For the second group, we have 4 remaining members to choose from, and we again need to choose 2. This gives us 4 choose 2: 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6.
For the third group, we have 2 remaining members to choose from, and we need to choose 2. This gives us 2 choose 2: 1.
To find the total number of combinations, we simply multiply these three values together: 15 * 6 * 1 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 different possible combinations of groups that the Power Rangers team can create.

Topic: Spiderman Question: Spiderman has to stop a train that is moving at a speed of 100 miles per hour. If Spidey can run at a speed of 50 miles per hour, how long will it take him to stop the train?

Solution:
def solution():

    train_speed = 100
    #Spiderman can run at a speed of 50 miles per hour

Solution:

Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, has two hammers. One hammer weighs 20 pounds more than the other hammer. Together, the hammers weigh 120 pounds. What is the weight of each hammer?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Together, the hammers weigh 120 pounds
    total_weight = 120
    #Let x be the weight of the lighter hammer
    #Then the weight of the heavier hammer is x + 20
    #The sum of their weights is x + (x + 20) = 2x + 20
    #We know that the sum of their weights is 120, so we can set up the equation:
    2x + 20 = 120
    #Solving for x, we get
    x = 50
    #Therefore, the weight of the lighter hammer is 50 pounds, and the weight of the heavier hammer is 70 pounds

Topic: trains Question: A train leaves Station A at 9:00 AM and travels towards Station B, which is 400 miles away. Another train leaves Station B at 10:00 AM and travels towards Station A on the same track. The second train travels 50 miles per hour faster than the first train. Both trains arrive at their respective destinations at the same time. What is the speed of each train?
Solution:
def solution():

    #Second train leaves Station B at 10:00 AM
    time_for_second_train = 2  #Assuming train moves with constant speed
    #Let's assume the first train's speed as x mph
    #Then the second train's speed is x + 50 mph, 50 mph faster
    #Using the formula distance = speed x time for both trains
    #distance = speed of first train x time of first train
    #400 = x * 1

    #distance = speed of second train x time of second train

    #The answer is

Topic: planes Question: A plane travels 800 miles in 2 hours with a tailwind. The return trip against the wind takes 3 hours and covers a distance of 600 miles. What is the speed of the plane in still air and the speed of the wind?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Let's assume the speed of the plane in still air is x and the speed of the wind is y
    #The plane travels 800 miles in 2 hours with the tailwind, so its speed is x + y
    #Thus, x + y = 400 (since distance = speed * time, and 800 miles in 2 hours is a speed of 400 miles per hour)
    #The return trip against the wind takes 3 hours and covers a distance of 600 miles, so its speed is x - y
    #Thus, x - y = 200 (since 600 miles in 3 hours is a speed of 200 miles per hour)
    #Now we have two equations with two variables. Solving them gives us:
    #x = 300 (speed of the plane in still air)

Topic: Pokémon Question: Ash Ketchum has caught a total of 50 Pokémon. He caught twice as many Pikachu as Charmander, and 10 more Squirtle than Bulbasaur. How many of each type of Pokemon did Ash catch?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Ash Ketchum has caught a total of 50 Pokémon.

    pikachu = 2 * charmander

    #Using total_pokemon and the equations above, we can solve for the other variables.
    #charmander + pikachu + bulbasaur + squirtle = total_pokemon
    #charmander + 2*charmander + bulbasaur + bulbasaur + 10 = total_pokemon
    #4*charmander + 2*bulbasaur = total_pokemon - 10
