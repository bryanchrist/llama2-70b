**Correction:** The correct answer should be calculated as follows: Ash has already caught 50 Pokémon and needs to catch a total of 150. Thus, he needs to catch 150 - 50 = 100 more Pokémon. Catching 4 Pokémon each day would take 100/4 = 25 days."

If he needs to average 30 points per game in the next 5 games to maintain his average of 28 points per game for the season, how many points does he need to score in the next 5 games?', 'answer': '150', 'appropriateness': 1.0, 'explanation': 'This question is at an appropriate mathematical difficulty for K-8 students. It involves understanding averages and multiplication without requiring advanced mathematics. The context is realistic, is relevant to students who may be interested in basketball, and the problem is free from grammar errors and typos. It requires mathematical operations to arrive at the final correct answer.'}

Note: The provided 'answer' of -100 is incorrect, so I have provided the correct answer in addition to the evaluation. Here is the calculation for reference:

LeBron currently has an average of 25 points over 10 games, which is a total of 25 * 10 = 250 points. 

To maintain an average of 28 points over a total of 15 games (10 past games + 5 future games), he would need to have 28 * 15 = 420 points in total.

Having already scored 250 points, he would need 420 - 250 = 170 more points to maintain the average.

Averaging 30 points per game over the next 5 games would give him 30 * 5 = 150 points, which is less than the 170 points needed, meaning the question as stated has an unrealistic expectation. 

However, if the intention was to calculate how many points he needs to score in the next 5 games to achieve the suggested average (28 points over 15 games), then it should be:

170 points needed / 5 games = 34 points per game.

This means LeBron would need to score 34 points per game for the next 5 games, with the final answer being 170 points needed in the next 5 games. The evaluation remains the same, but the original solution provided in the problem statement is wrong."
