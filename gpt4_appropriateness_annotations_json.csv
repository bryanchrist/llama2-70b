48,The basketball team has 10 players. Each player has 2 shoes. How many shoes does the team have?,20,0.0,"The question, while solvable and containing simple multiplication, is strange because it is an unrealistic assessment of counting objects typically considered as pairs. It is rare that a word problem would need to specify the number of shoes for a group of people as each individual having two is an assumed fact for most capable individuals.",

128,Patrick Mahomes completed 38 of 50 passes and Ryan Fitzpatrick completed 31 of 50 passes. Who completed more passing attempts?,7,0.0,"The question is inappropriate because it contains an error in the wording that leads to confusion. The term 'passing attempts' refers to the number of passes a player tries to make, not the number of successful completions. Both players attempted 50 passes, so stating that one completed more 'passing attempts' is incorrect. Additionally, the answer provided does not match the question; it seems to suggest the difference in successful completions rather than identifying who completed more passing attempts. Therefore, this question is misleading and does not have a proper mathematical context within its narrative.",
