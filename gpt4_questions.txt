Topic: field hockey Question: In a field hockey tournament, each team plays 3 games. If there are 8 teams in the tournament, how many total games are played?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 8 teams in the tournament
    number_of_teams = 8
    # Each team plays 3 games
    games_per_team = 3
    # Since each game involves two teams, the total number of games each team plays
    # has to be divided by 2 to avoid counting the same game twice
    total_games = (number_of_teams * games_per_team) // 2
    return total_games
```

This assumes that each team plays each other team only once. The "//" operator in Python ensures that the result is an integer.
Topic: Superman Question: Superman helps a construction company by moving steel beams. He can carry 10 beams at once. If there are 5 construction sites, and each site needs 6 beams, how many trips does Superman have to make to deliver all the beams?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Superman can carry 10 beams at once
    carry_capacity = 10
    # There are 5 construction sites
    sites = 5
    # Each site needs 6 beams
    beams_per_site = 6
    # Calculate the total number of beams needed
    total_beams_needed = sites * beams_per_site
    # Calculate the number of trips Superman has to make
    trips = total_beams_needed / carry_capacity
    
    # Since Superman can't take a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if necessary
    # Import the math module to use the ceil function
    import math
    trips = math.ceil(trips)
    return trips

# Uncomment the following line to test the function
# print(solution())
```

In the given function, we first calculate the total number of beams required by multiplying the number of sites by the number of beams per site. We then divide the total number of beams by the number Superman can carry at once to determine the number of trips he needs to make. We use the `math.ceil` function to round up to the nearest whole number to account for the scenario where Superman can't make a fraction of a trip, ensuring he delivers all the beams in whole trips.
Topic: Wonder Woman Question:
Wonder Woman needs to stop a train that is rushing uncontrollably towards a city. The train is 300 miles away from the city and is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Wonder Woman can fly at a speed of 150 miles per hour. If she leaves now, how long will it take her to reach the train before it gets to the city?

Solution:
```python
def time_to_reach_train():
    # Distance from the city to the train
    distance_to_train = 300
    # Train's speed
    train_speed = 60
    # Wonder Woman's flying speed
    wonder_woman_speed = 150
    
    # The time it takes for Wonder Woman to reach the train is the distance to the train
    # divided by the difference in speeds (since they are closing in on each other)
    time_to_reach = distance_to_train / (wonder_woman_speed - train_speed)
    
    # The answer is the time to reach
    return time_to_reach

# Call the function and print the result
print(time_to_reach_train())
```
The function provided calculates the time it will take Wonder Woman to reach the train based on the given speeds and distance to prevent it from reaching the city. The print statement at the end is calling the function and displaying the result.
Topic: volleyball Question: A volleyball team won 15 games this season, which was three times as many as last season. How many games did the volleyball team win last season?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The team won 15 games this season
    games_won_this_season = 15
    # The number of games won this season was three times last season's
    games_won_last_season = games_won_this_season / 3
    # The answer is
    return games_won_last_season
```
Topic: ice cream Question: A group of friends goes to an ice cream shop. There are 3 flavors of ice cream available: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. If each friend can choose one scoop of any flavor, and no combination of flavors is the same, how many different combinations of ice cream scoops can the group have if there are 4 friends?

Solution:
```python
def ice_cream_combinations(friends, flavors):
    # The number of friends
    number_of_friends = friends
    # The number of ice cream flavors available
    number_of_flavors = flavors
    # Since each friend can choose any flavor, and no two friends can have the same combination,
    # We will use the permutation formula: P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!
    # n is the number of flavors and r is the number of friends
    from math import factorial
    result = factorial(number_of_flavors) / factorial(number_of_flavors - number_of_friends)
    return result

# Using the function to calculate the number of different combinations for 4 friends and 3 flavors
print(ice_cream_combinations(4, 3))
```

The Python function `ice_cream_combinations` first imports the `factorial` function from `math` module to calculate permutations. In this case, there are 3 flavors, so `n` is 3, and there are 4 friends, so `r` is 4. However, since the number of friends is more than the number of flavors, it is not possible to have all unique combinations for 4 friends when only 3 flavors are available. Therefore, it may be necessary to correct the question or the function to accommodate the conditions provided. For instance, if the number of unique combinations without repetition is sought for 3 friends, the corrected function would be called as `ice_cream_combinations(3, 3)`.
Topic: Power Rangers Question: Five Power Rangers are each fighting an equal number of monsters. If there are a total of 35 monsters, how many monsters is each Power Ranger fighting?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are a total of 35 monsters
    total_monsters = 35
    # There are 5 Power Rangers
    number_of_rangers = 5
    # Each Power Ranger is fighting an equal number of monsters
    monsters_per_ranger = total_monsters / number_of_rangers
    return monsters_per_ranger
```

By running this function, it would return the number of monsters each Power Ranger is fighting. In this case, `solution()` would return `7`, because each Ranger is fighting 7 monsters (`35 monsters / 5 rangers = 7 monsters per ranger`).
Topic: Power Rangers Question: The Power Rangers are fighting a monster and need to call their Zords. Each Zord consumes 250 units of energy to be summoned. There are 5 Power Rangers, and they each call their Zord once. The energy is taken from the Power Grid which had 2000 units of energy stored. How many units of energy will be left in the Power Grid after all the Zords have been summoned?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Each Zord consumes 250 units of energy
    energy_per_zord = 250
    # There are 5 Power Rangers
    number_of_rangers = 5
    # Energy stored in the Power Grid
    power_grid_energy = 2000
    # Calculate the total energy consumed
    total_energy_consumed = energy_per_zord * number_of_rangers
    # Calculate the energy left in the Power Grid
    energy_left = power_grid_energy - total_energy_consumed
    # The answer is
    return energy_left
```

    # After a break, he throws another 11 footballs
    thrown_footballs_second_round = 11
    # Calculate the remaining footballs by subtracting the thrown footballs from the total
    remaining = total_footballs - thrown_footballs_first_round - thrown_footballs_second_round
    # The answer is the number of footballs remaining in the bag
    return remaining
```
_Call the function to get the solution:_
```python

Solution:
```python
def total_pizza_slices():
    # Leonardo's pizza order
    leonardo_pizzas = 2
    # Michelangelo's pizza order
    michelangelo_pizzas = 5
    # Donatello's pizza order
    donatello_pizzas = 3
    # Raphael's pizza order
    raphael_pizzas = 4
    # Number of slices per pizza
    slices_per_pizza = 8
    
    # Total pizzas ordered by all turtles
    total_pizzas = leonardo_pizzas + michelangelo_pizzas + donatello_pizzas + raphael_pizzas
    # Total slices of pizza
    total_slices = total_pizzas * slices_per_pizza
    
    return total_slices

# Call the function to find out the total slices
print(total_pizza_slices())
```

This Python function `total_pizza_slices()` calculates the total number of pizza slices ordered by the Ninja Turtles by summing their individual orders and multiplying by the number of slices per pizza.

    # One lap around the track is 5 miles
    miles_per_lap = 5
    # Captain America runs 4 laps in the morning
    morning_laps = 4
    # He runs 3 more laps in the afternoon
    afternoon_laps = 3
    # Total number of laps

Topic: Harry Potter Question: At Hogwarts, Harry Potter attends a class where each student is given 7 potion ingredients. If there are 15 students in the class and Professor Snape adds 5 extra ingredients to the class's total supply, how many potion ingredients are there in total?

Solution:
```python
def total_potion_ingredients(students, ingredients_per_student, extra_ingredients):
    # Each student is given 7 potion ingredients
    total_ingredients = students * ingredients_per_student
    # Professor Snape adds 5 extra ingredients to the class's total supply
    total_ingredients += extra_ingredients
    # The answer is the total number of potion ingredients
    return total_ingredients

# Example usage:
# There are 15 students in the class
students_in_class = 15
# Each student gets 7 ingredients
ingredients_each_student = 7
# Snape adds 5 extra ingredients in total
extra_ingredients_added = 5

# Calculate the total number of potion ingredients
total_ingredients = total_potion_ingredients(students_in_class, ingredients_each_student, extra_ingredients_added)
print(total_ingredients)  # This will print 110
```
In this example, the function `total_potion_ingredients` calculates the total number of potion ingredients by multiplying the number of students by the number of ingredients each student receives. It then adds the number of extra ingredients provided by Professor Snape. The use of the function then prints the result, which tells us how many potion ingredients are in total.

Topic: Taylor Swift Question: Taylor Swift decides to have a concert in three different cities. In the first city, she sells 10,000 tickets. In the second city, she sells twice as many tickets as in the first city. In the third city, she sells 5,000 fewer tickets than in the second city. How many tickets in total does Taylor Swift sell for all three concerts?

Solution:
```python
def tickets_sold():
    # Tickets sold in the first city
    first_city_tickets = 10000
    
    # Tickets sold in the second city (twice as many as the first city)
    second_city_tickets = 2 * first_city_tickets
    
    # Tickets sold in the third city (5,000 fewer than the second city)
    third_city_tickets = second_city_tickets - 5000
    
    # Calculate total tickets sold
    total_tickets = first_city_tickets + second_city_tickets + third_city_tickets
    
    # Return the total tickets sold
    return total_tickets

# Calling the function and printing the result
total_tickets_sold = tickets_sold()
print(f"Taylor Swift sold a total of {total_tickets_sold} tickets for all three concerts.")
```

The given Python function `tickets_sold` calculates the number of tickets sold by Taylor Swift for three different city concerts. The function uses simple arithmetic to find the total tickets sold. It defines variables for the number of tickets sold in each city, calculates the total and returns the total number of tickets sold, which can then be printed out.
Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, has to defeat an army of 500 ice giants to save Asgard. If he vanquishes 120 ice giants each day, how many days will it take for Thor to defeat the entire army?

Solution:
```python
def days_to_defeat_ice_giants():
    # Total number of ice giants
    total_ice_giants = 500
    # Number of ice giants defeated each day
    ice_giants_per_day = 120
    # The answer is the total number of ice giants divided by the number of ice giants defeated each day
    # Assuming Thor fights every day without taking a break
    days_needed = total_ice_giants // ice_giants_per_day
    # If there's a remainder, add an extra day for the remaining ice giants
    if total_ice_giants % ice_giants_per_day > 0:
        days_needed += 1
    return days_needed
```

This function calculates the number of days Thor needs to defeat all the ice giants. It does integer division since you can't have a fraction of a day, and it adds a day if there are any leftover ice giants after dividing.
Topic: Harry Potter ### Word Problem: Harry Potter is organizing his potions for the upcoming term at Hogwarts. He has 8 bottles of Polyjuice Potion, 5 bottles of Felix Felicis, and double the amount of Gillyweed potions compared to Polyjuice Potions. How many potions does he have in total?

### Python Function:

```python
def total_potions():
    # Number of Polyjuice Potion bottles
    polyjuice = 8
    # Number of Felix Felicis bottles
    felix_felicis = 5
    # Number of Gillyweed bottles is double the Polyjuice
    gillyweed = polyjuice * 2
    # The total potions is the sum of all the potions
    total = polyjuice + felix_felicis + gillyweed
    # Return the total number of potions
    return total
```

To find the total number of potions Harry has, we add up the number of each type of potion. The function `total_potions` calculates this total.
Topic: Serena Williams ### Question:
Serena Williams is playing in a tennis tournament. In the first round, she won in 2 sets, scoring 6 games in each set. In the second round, she played 3 sets and won with scores of 6-3, 5-7, and 6-4. How many games did Serena win in total during the first two rounds of the tournament?

### Solution:
```python
def games_won_by_serena():
    # In the first round, Serena won 2 sets with 6 games each
    games_won_first_round = 2 * 6
    
    # In the second round, she won 2 sets and lost 1 set
    # Winning sets scores are 6 and 6, losing set score is 5
    games_won_second_round = 6 + 5 + 6
    
    # The total number of games won across both rounds
    total_games_won = games_won_first_round + games_won_second_round
    
    return total_games_won

# Call the function and output the result
print(games_won_by_serena())
```
This Python function will calculate the total number of games Serena Williams won during the first two rounds. By summing up the games won in each round, we get the total count of her victories.
Topic: ice cream Question: An ice cream shop sells 3 different flavors of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. If a customer buys a total of 8 scoops and the shop records 3 scoops of vanilla, 4 scoops of chocolate, how many scoops of strawberry did the customer buy?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of scoops bought by the customer
    total_scoops = 8

    # Number of vanilla scoops bought
    vanilla_scoops = 3

    # Number of chocolate scoops bought
    chocolate_scoops = 4

    # The number of strawberry scoops is the remaining scoops
    strawberry_scoops = total_scoops - vanilla_scoops - chocolate_scoops

    return strawberry_scoops
```

When you call the function `solution()`, it would return the number of strawberry scoops bought by the customer.
Topic: soccer Question: A soccer team played 20 games last season. They won twice as many games as they lost and drew the rest. If the team had 5 draws, how many games did they win and how many did they lose?

Solution:
```python
def soccer_stats():
    # Total games played
    total_games = 20
    # Number of games drawn
    games_drawn = 5
    # The number of games that were not draws (either wins or losses)
    games_not_drawn = total_games - games_drawn
    
    # They won twice as many as they lost, so let's denote the number of lost games as "x"
    # This means the number of won games would be "2x"
    # The equation for games not drawn would then be: x (lost games) + 2x (won games) = games_not_drawn
    # Which simplifies to: 3x = games_not_drawn
    # Solving for x, we divide both sides by 3
    games_lost = games_not_drawn // 3
    games_won = 2 * games_lost
    
    # Results:
    return games_won, games_lost

# Call the function to get the results
win, lose = soccer_stats()
print(f"The team won {win} games and lost {lose} games.")
```
In this problem, we first calculate how many games were not draws. Since the team won twice as many games as they lost, we use a simple equation to solve for the number of lost games, then calculate the number of won games. We could use whole number division (//) assuming there cannot be a fraction of a game played, ensuring integer output for games won and lost.
Topic: lacrosse Question: During a lacrosse match, Annie scored 7 goals in the first half of the game. After halftime, she scored twice as many goals as in the first half. How many goals did Annie score in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Annie scored 7 goals in the first half
    goals_first_half = 7
    # She scored twice as many in the second half
    goals_second_half = 2 * goals_first_half
    # The total number of goals Annie scored is
    total_goals = goals_first_half + goals_second_half
    return total_goals

# Call the function to get the result
total_goals_scored = solution()
```
This function calculates the total amount of goals scored by Annie in both halves. We begin by assigning the given value (7 goals) to the first half and then use it to find out that she scored twice as many in the second half by multiplying by 2 (2 * 7 goals). Lastly, we add both halves together to find the total number of goals scored (7 + 14 goals).
Topic: planes Question: An airline operates a flight from New York to Los Angeles with 3 different types of planes. Plane A can carry 180 passengers, Plane B can carry 220 passengers, and Plane C can carry 250 passengers. On one particular day, 5 Plane A flights and 3 Plane B flights are fully booked. If the airline needs to transport a total of 2000 passengers, how many Plane C flights will be necessary to transport the remaining passengers?

Solution:
```python
def plane_c_flights_needed():
    # Plane A capacity
    plane_a_capacity = 180
    # Plane B capacity
    plane_b_capacity = 220
    # Plane C capacity
    plane_c_capacity = 250
    # Total passengers needed to transport
    total_passengers = 2000
    # Calculate the number of passengers transported by Plane A and Plane B
    passengers_by_plane_a = 5 * plane_a_capacity
    passengers_by_plane_b = 3 * plane_b_capacity
    # Total passengers already transported
    total_passengers_transported = passengers_by_plane_a + passengers_by_plane_b
    # Remaining passengers to be transported
    remaining_passengers = total_passengers - total_passengers_transported
    # Calculate the number of Plane C flights needed by dividing the remaining passengers
    # by the capacity of Plane C and using the ceiling to ensure all passengers are transported
    from math import ceil
    plane_c_flights_needed = ceil(remaining_passengers / plane_c_capacity)
    return plane_c_flights_needed

# Call the function to get the number of Plane C flights needed
number_of_plane_c_flights = plane_c_flights_needed()
print(f"Number of Plane C flights needed: {number_of_plane_c_flights}")
```

The function calculates the number of passengers that can be transported by the fully booked Plane A and Plane B flights. It then determines how many passengers are left to transport and calculates how many Plane C flights would be needed to transport the remaining passengers, rounding up to the nearest whole flight as partial flights aren't possible.
Topic: Captain Marvel Question: Captain Marvel is on a mission to collect energy cells to power her spaceship. She found 6 energy cells on the first planet, twice as many on the second planet, and on the third planet, she found 3 fewer than on the second planet. How many energy cells did Captain Marvel collect from all three planets?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Captain Marvel found 6 cells on the first planet
    first_planet_cells = 6
    # She found twice as many cells on the second planet compared to the first
    second_planet_cells = first_planet_cells * 2
    # She found 3 fewer cells on the third planet compared to the second
    third_planet_cells = second_planet_cells - 3
    # The total number of cells collected from all three planets is
    total_cells = first_planet_cells + second_planet_cells + third_planet_cells
    return total_cells

# Now, let's call the function and print the answer.
print(solution())  # This will print the total number of cells collected.
```

By running this Python function, Captain Marvel can quickly calculate the total number of energy cells she collected from all three planets.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 6 cheerleaders on the squad
    cheerleaders = 6
    # Each cheerleader performs 8 flips
    flips_per_cheerleader = 8
    # The total number of flips performed is
    total_flips = cheerleaders * flips_per_cheerleader
    return total_flips
```

This Python function calculates the total number of flips performed by the cheerleading squad by multiplying the number of cheerleaders by the number of flips each cheerleader performs.
Topic: Super Mario Question:
Super Mario is on a quest to save Princess Peach. He needs to collect 100 gold coins to buy a magic key that opens the castle door. If Mario already has 35 gold coins, and he collects 10 gold coins for each Goomba he defeats, how many Goombas does Mario need to defeat to have enough gold coins?

Solution:
```python
def mario_coins_to_goombas():
    # Super Mario starts with 35 gold coins
    mario_coins = 35
    # Each Goomba defeated gives Mario 10 gold coins
    coins_per_goomba = 10
    # Mario needs 100 gold coins in total
    total_needed_coins = 100
    # Mario needs to collect this many more coins
    coins_needed = total_needed_coins - mario_coins
    # Calculating how many Goombas Mario needs to defeat
    goombas_needed = coins_needed / coins_per_goomba
    # Since Mario can't defeat a fraction of a Goomba, we round up to the nearest whole number
    from math import ceil
    goombas_needed = ceil(goombas_needed)
    # The answer is
    return goombas_needed

# Example use of the function:
goombas_to_defeat = mario_coins_to_goombas()
print(f"Mario needs to defeat {goombas_to_defeat} Goombas.")
```

The function `mario_coins_to_goombas()` calculates the number of Goombas Mario must defeat to get the necessary 100 gold coins by subtracting the coins he already has from the 100 needed, then dividing by the amount he gets per Goomba defeated, ensuring to round up since he can't defeat a partial Goomba.
Topic: soccer Question: A soccer team has played 15 games this season. They won twice as many games as they lost and tied 3 games. How many games did the soccer team win?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total games played
    total_games = 15
    # Tied games
    tied_games = 3
    # Let's assume the number of lost games is x
    # Therefore, the number of won games is 2*x
    # The total number of games is the sum of won, lost, and tied games: 2*x + x + 3 = 15
    
    # To find the number of lost games (x), we first isolate x in the equation:
    # 3*x + 3 = 15
    # 3*x = 15 - 3
    # 3*x = 12
    # x = 12 / 3
    lost_games = (total_games - tied_games) / 3
    
    # Since the team won twice as many as they lost, we simply double the number of lost games to find the number of won games
    won_games = 2 * lost_games
    return int(won_games)

# Call the function to get the number of games the soccer team won
games_won = solution()
print(f'The soccer team won {games_won} games.')
```

This Python function calculates the number of games the soccer team won by setting up an equation based on the information given, solving for the unknown number of lost games, and then using that number to determine the number of games won.

Topic: Iron Man Question: Iron Man is testing his new Mark L armor and decides to fly around the city. In his first test, he flies 300 miles to the north. Then he turns east and flies 200 miles. How far is Iron Man from the starting point?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Iron Man flies 300 miles to the north
    north_travel = 300
    # Then he flies 200 miles to the east
    east_travel = 200
    # To find the distance from the starting point, we use the Pythagorean theorem
    distance_from_start = (north_travel**2 + east_travel**2)**0.5
    return distance_from_start
```

To solve for the distance from the starting point after Iron Man has flown north and then east, we use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) where `north_travel` and `east_travel` are the legs of a right triangle and `distance_from_start` is the hypotenuse. This gives us the straight-line distance from Iron Man's starting point to his final position.
Topic: Power Rangers ### Question:
In Angel Grove, there were 5 Power Rangers battling against an invasion of 100 space aliens. The Red Ranger defeated 20 aliens, the Blue Ranger defeated 15, and the Yellow Ranger defeated 10. The remaining aliens were equally divided and defeated by the Black and Pink Rangers. How many aliens did the Black and Pink Rangers each defeat?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total space aliens
    total_aliens = 100
    # Red Ranger defeated 20 aliens
    red_ranger_aliens = 20
    # Blue Ranger defeated 15 aliens
    blue_ranger_aliens = 15
    # Yellow Ranger defeated 10 aliens
    yellow_ranger_aliens = 10
    # Aliens defeated by the Red, Blue, and Yellow Rangers
    aliens_defeated = red_ranger_aliens + blue_ranger_aliens + yellow_ranger_aliens
    # Remaining aliens that Black and Pink Rangers will defeat
    remaining_aliens = total_aliens - aliens_defeated
    # Since the remaining aliens are divided equally, we split in half
    black_ranger_aliens = remaining_aliens // 2
    pink_ranger_aliens = remaining_aliens // 2
    # Each of the Black and Pink Rangers defeated this many aliens
    return black_ranger_aliens

# Calling the function to get the result

Topic: soccer Question: In a soccer league, the Lionhearts played 4 soccer matches this week. They won 3 of those games and tied 1 game. A win is worth 3 points, and a tie is worth 1 point. How many points did the Lionhearts earn this week?

Solution:
```python
def calculate_soccer_points():
    # Number of games won by the Lionhearts
    games_won = 3
    # Number of games tied by the Lionhearts
    games_tied = 1
    # Points earned for each win
    points_per_win = 3
    # Points earned for each tie
    points_per_tie = 1
    # The total points earned is
    total_points = (games_won * points_per_win) + (games_tied * points_per_tie)
    return total_points
```
Topic: Patrick Mahomes Question: Patrick Mahomes has thrown for a total of 4000 yards this season. If he plays 16 games in the season, how many yards does he need to average per game to throw for a total of 5000 yards?

Solution:
```python
def yards_per_game():
    # Total yards Patrick Mahomes has thrown so far
    current_yards = 4000
    # Total goal for the season
    total_goal_yards = 5000
    # Number of games in the season
    total_games = 16
    # Yards still needed to reach the goal
    yards_needed = total_goal_yards - current_yards
    # Average yards per game required
    avg_yards_per_game = yards_needed / total_games
    return avg_yards_per_game

# We can call the function and print the result
print(yards_per_game())
```
Explanation of the solution:
1. First, we set the current number of yards thrown by Patrick Mahomes to 4000.
2. We set the goal for the season at 5000 yards.
3. We acknowledge that there are 16 games to be played in total.
4. We find out how many more yards are needed to reach the goal by subtracting the current yards from the total goal yards.
5. Finally, we divide the yards needed by the total number of games to find the average number of yards that Patrick Mahomes needs to throw per game to reach the goal.
Topic: unicorns Question: In the enchanted forest, there are 12 unicorns. Each unicorn has the magic ability to double the number of cupcakes it gets from the fairy each day. On Monday, each unicorn received 3 cupcakes from the fairy. On Tuesday, they each received double what they got on Monday. How many cupcakes did all the unicorns receive in total on Tuesday?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The number of unicorns
    num_unicorns = 12
    # Cupcakes received by each unicorn on Monday
    cupcakes_monday = 3
    # Each unicorn receives double the amount of cupcakes on Tuesday
    cupcakes_tuesday = cupcakes_monday * 2
    # Total cupcakes received by all unicorns on Tuesday
    total_cupcakes = num_unicorns * cupcakes_tuesday
    return total_cupcakes
```

This function `solution` calculates the total number of cupcakes the unicorns received on Tuesday by doubling the number of cupcakes they received on Monday and multiplying by the total number of unicorns.

The Pink Ranger has 1 more than the Red Ranger. How many Power Coins do the Power Rangers have in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The Red Ranger has 5 Power Coins
    red_ranger_coins = 5
    # The Blue Ranger has 7 Power Coins
    blue_ranger_coins = 7
    # The Yellow Ranger has 3 less than the Blue Ranger
    yellow_ranger_coins = blue_ranger_coins - 3
    # The Green Ranger has twice as many as the Yellow Ranger
    green_ranger_coins = yellow_ranger_coins * 2
    # The Pink Ranger has 1 more than the Red Ranger
    pink_ranger_coins = red_ranger_coins + 1
    # The total number of Power Coins is
    total_coins = red_ranger_coins + blue_ranger_coins + yellow_ranger_coins + green_ranger_coins + pink_ranger_coins
    return total_coins

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This function defines the number of Power Coins for each Power Ranger and then adds them up to find the total number of Power Coins. It then returns this total. Calling `solution()` will execute the code and print the result.

    fence_blocks_needed = perimeter
    return fence_blocks_needed
```
This Python function calculates the number of fence blocks Steve needs to enclose his rectangular garden by first calculating the perimeter of the rectangle and then determining the total amount of fence blocks that corresponds to the perimeter.
Topic: trains ### Question:
Two trains are traveling on parallel tracks. One train is moving at 60 miles per hour, and the other at 70 miles per hour. If the slower train has a one-hour head start, how far apart will the two trains be after the faster train has been running for two hours?

### Solution:
```python
def distance_apart():
    # Speed of the slower train
    speed_slower_train = 60  # miles per hour
    
    # Speed of the faster train
    speed_faster_train = 70  # miles per hour
    
    # Head start time for the slower train
    head_start = 1  # hour
    
    # Time the faster train has been running
    time_faster_train = 2  # hours
    
    # Distance the slower train covers during its head start
    distance_slower_train_head_start = speed_slower_train * head_start  # 60 miles

    # Total distance covered by the slower train after two hours
    # (one hour head start plus one hour after the faster train starts)
    total_distance_slower_train = distance_slower_train_head_start + (speed_slower_train * time_faster_train)  # 180 miles
    
    # Total distance covered by the faster train after two hours
    total_distance_faster_train = speed_faster_train * time_faster_train  # 140 miles

    # The difference in distance is how far apart the two trains will be.
    result = total_distance_slower_train - total_distance_faster_train  # 40 miles

    return result

# Call the function and print the result
print(f"The two trains will be {distance_apart()} miles apart after the faster train has been running for two hours.")
```

The function calculates the distance each train travels in the given times and finds the difference to determine how far apart the two trains will be after the specified duration.

    # The answer is the total cups of flour used.
    return total_cups
```
This function will return the total number of cups of flour that Hello Kitty used for making 4 batches of cookies.
Topic: cars Question: A car rental company has a fleet of 150 cars. On Monday, they rented out 67 cars. On Tuesday, they had to take 13 cars for maintenance and therefore were not available for rent. How many cars does the company have available for rent now?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The company starts with 150 cars
    total_cars = 150
    # On Monday, 67 cars were rented out
    cars_rented_out = 67
    # On Tuesday, 13 cars were taken for maintenance
    cars_for_maintenance = 13
    # The number of cars available for rent is the initial number minus the rented and maintenance cars
    available_cars = total_cars - cars_rented_out - cars_for_maintenance
    # The answer is
    return available_cars

# Calling the solution function and printing the result
print(solution())  # This will print the number of available cars for rent
```

When we run this Python function, it will perform the calculation and return the number of cars that are still available for rent after those that were rented out and taken for maintenance are subtracted from the total fleet.

Topic: Power Rangers Question: The Power Rangers are trying to save the city from an incoming army of 500 robots. The Blue Ranger can disable 50 robots an hour, the Pink Ranger can disable 30 robots an hour, and the Red Ranger can disable twice as many robots as the Pink Ranger. If they all work together, how many hours will it take to disable all the robots?

### Python Function:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of robots
    total_robots = 500
    # Robots disabled per hour by the Blue Ranger
    blue_ranger_rate = 50
    # Robots disabled per hour by the Pink Ranger
    pink_ranger_rate = 30
    # Robots disabled per hour by the Red Ranger (twice the rate of Pink Ranger)
    red_ranger_rate = 2 * pink_ranger_rate
    # Total robots disabled per hour when all Rangers work together
    total_rate = blue_ranger_rate + pink_ranger_rate + red_ranger_rate
    # The number of hours needed to disable all robots
    hours_needed = total_robots / total_rate
    return hours_needed
```

Executing the Python function `solution()` will return the number of hours the Power Rangers need to disable all the robots by working together. The calculation is based on their individual rates of disabling robots combined to find the total rate, and then dividing the total number of robots by this combined rate.
Topic: Superman ### Question:
Superman is helping to build a new skyscraper. He can lift 10 steel beams per hour and he works for 4 hours a day. If the skyscraper needs a total of 120 steel beams, how many days will it take for Superman to finish lifting all the beams?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Superman lifts 10 steel beams per hour
    beams_per_hour = 10
    # He works 4 hours a day
    hours_per_day = 4
    # Total steel beams needed for the skyscraper
    total_beams = 120
    
    # Beams Superman can lift per day
    beams_per_day = beams_per_hour * hours_per_day
    # Number of days to lift all beams
    days_needed = total_beams // beams_per_day
    if total_beams % beams_per_day != 0:  # If there is a remainder, we need an extra day
        days_needed += 1

    return days_needed

# Now calling the function and printing the result
print(solution())
```
In this function, we first calculate how many beams Superman can lift per day, and then divide the total number of beams by this daily amount to find out how many days are needed. If there is any remainder, it means Superman will need an extra day to finish lifting the remaining beams.

    # Number of students in the class
    students = 25
    # Slices of pizza each student wants
    slices_per_student = 3
    # Total slices needed
    total_slices_needed = students * slices_per_student
    # Number of slices per pizza
    slices_per_pizza = 8
    # Number of pizzas needed. Since we can't have a fraction of a pizza, we use ceiling division to round up to the nearest whole number
    pizzas_needed = -(-total_slices_needed // slices_per_pizza)
    return pizzas_needed

```python
import math

def calculate_pizzas_needed():
    # Each student wants 3 slices of pizza
    slices_needed_per_student = 3
    # There are 25 students in the class
    num_students = 25
    # Total number of slices needed is the number of students multiplied by the number of slices each wants
    total_slices_needed = num_students * slices_needed_per_student
    # Since each pizza has 8 slices
    slices_per_pizza = 8
    # The number of pizzas needed is the total number of slices needed divided by the number of slices per pizza.
    # We use math.ceil to round up to the next whole number because we can't order a fraction of a pizza
    number_of_pizzas = math.ceil(total_slices_needed / slices_per_pizza)
    return number_of_pizzas

# Now we call the function to find out how many pizzas the teacher should order
print(calculate_pizzas_needed())
```
Topic: pizza Question: A pizza shop sells pizzas that are cut into 8 slices each. If a group of 3 friends orders 2 pizzas and they equally share the slices among themselves so that each friend gets the same number of whole slices, how many slices will each friend get?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Each pizza is cut into 8 slices
    slices_per_pizza = 8
    # There are 2 pizzas ordered
    total_pizzas = 2
    # The total number of slices is 8 slices per pizza multiplied by 2 pizzas
    total_slices = slices_per_pizza * total_pizzas
    # There are 3 friends sharing the slices
    friends_count = 3
    # Each friend will get an equal number of whole slices
    # We use integer division to ensure we only count whole slices
    slices_per_friend = total_slices // friends_count
    return slices_per_friend

# Uncomment the following line to test the function
# print(solution())
```

To solve this problem, you would first calculate the total number of pizza slices by multiplying the number of slices per pizza by the number of pizzas. Then you would divide the total number of slices by the number of friends, making sure to use integer division (//) to get the number of whole slices per friend. The answer should be the number of slices that each friend gets.

Solution:
```python
def arrival_time():
    # The speed of the train is 60 mph
    speed_mph = 60
    # The distance between City A and City B is 240 miles
    distance_miles = 240
    # Calculate the travel time in hours
    travel_time_hours = distance_miles / speed_mph
    # Convert travel time to minutes for easier addition
    travel_time_minutes = travel_time_hours * 60
    # Departure time is 8:00 AM
    departure_time_minutes = 8 * 60  # 8 hours converted to minutes
    # Calculate arrival time in minutes
    arrival_time_minutes = departure_time_minutes + travel_time_minutes
    # Convert arrival time back to hours and minutes
    arrival_hour = arrival_time_minutes // 60
    arrival_minute = arrival_time_minutes % 60
    # Format the arrival time in 'HH:MM AM/PM' format
    am_pm = "AM" if arrival_hour < 12 else "PM"
    arrival_hour = arrival_hour % 12 or 12  # Convert to 12-hour format
    arrival_time_formatted = f"{arrival_hour}:{arrival_minute:02d} {am_pm}"
    return arrival_time_formatted

# Now let's call the function
print(arrival_time())
```

This function calculates the arrival time by dividing the distance by speed to get the travel time, which is then added to the departure time to get the arrival time. The result is adjusted to a 12-hour clock format and returned as a string formatted to indicate the exact arrival time.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The monster has 1000 hit points
    monster_hit_points = 1000
    # Each Power Ranger attack deals 150 hit points of damage
    attack_damage = 150
    # All 5 Power Rangers attack the monster once each
    number_of_rangers = 5
    # Total damage is attack damage multiplied by the number of Power Rangers
    total_damage = attack_damage * number_of_rangers
    # The answer is the original hit points minus the total damage
    hit_points_left = monster_hit_points - total_damage
    return hit_points_left
```
Calling the `solution()` function will return the number of hit points the monster has left after the attacks.

print(f"Each row will have {flowers_each_row} flowers.")
```

This would give us the number of flowers Alex will plant in each row of her Minecraft garden.
Topic: Power Rangers Question: During a week of intense battles, the Power Rangers defeated 15 evil monsters on Monday, twice as many on Tuesday as on Monday, and 10 fewer on Wednesday than on Tuesday. How many monsters did they defeat in total from Monday to Wednesday?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of monsters defeated by the Power Rangers on Monday.
    monday_monsters = 15
    # On Tuesday, they defeated twice as many as on Monday.
    tuesday_monsters = 2 * monday_monsters
    # On Wednesday, they defeated 10 fewer than on Tuesday.
    wednesday_monsters = tuesday_monsters - 10
    # The total number of monsters defeated from Monday to Wednesday is:
    total_monsters = monday_monsters + tuesday_monsters + wednesday_monsters
    return total_monsters
```

Let's break it down:
1. The Power Rangers defeated 15 monsters on Monday.
2. They defeated twice that number on Tuesday, so \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) monsters on Tuesday.
3. On Wednesday, they defeated 10 fewer than on Tuesday, so \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) monsters.
4. In total, over the three days, they defeated \( 15 + 30 + 20 = 65 \) monsters.

Remember to actually call the `solution()` function to execute it if running the Python code.
Topic: unicorns ### Question:
In a mystical land, 20 unicorns are playing in a meadow. Suddenly, 3 times as many unicorns join them from the neighboring forest. Unfortunately, during their play, 9 unicorns wandered off and didn't return. How many unicorns are in the meadow now?

### Solution:
```python
def count_unicorns():
    # Initial number of unicorns in the meadow
    initial_unicorns = 20
    # 3 times as many unicorns join from the forest
    unicorns_joined = 3 * initial_unicorns
    # 9 unicorns wander off
    unicorns_wandered_off = 9
    # The answer is
    result = initial_unicorns + unicorns_joined - unicorns_wandered_off
    return result

# Calling the function to find the number of unicorns now
number_of_unicorns = count_unicorns()
print("Number of unicorns in the meadow:", number_of_unicorns)
```

When you run this Python function, it will calculate the number of unicorns remaining in the meadow after accounting for those that joined and those that wandered off.
Topic: Black Panther Question: T'Challa, the Black Panther, has 120 Vibranium shards. He uses 35 shards to make a new shield for Captain America. His sister Shuri takes another 15 shards for her inventions. How many Vibranium shards does T'Challa have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # T'Challa originally has 120 Vibranium shards
    original_shards = 120
    # He uses 35 shards to make a new shield
    shards_for_shield = 35
    # Shuri takes 15 shards for her inventions
    shards_for_shuri = 15
    # Calculating the remaining shards
    remaining_shards = original_shards - shards_for_shield - shards_for_shuri
    # The answer is the number of shards left
    return remaining_shards
```
Topic: Fortnite Question: In a Fortnite Battle Royale match, there are 100 players. If one player can eliminate 4 opponents, how many players in the game can achieve such an elimination count, assuming no other players are eliminated?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 100 players in a match
    total_players = 100
    # One player can eliminate 4 opponents
    eliminations_per_player = 4
    # The answer is
    result = total_players // eliminations_per_player
    return result

# Let's run the function to find out the answer
print(solution())  # Output will be the number of players who can eliminate 4 opponents each
```
This solution assumes that each player who eliminates 4 opponents does not get eliminated themselves and that all possible eliminations are spread evenly. The `//` operator is used for integer division in Python, which discards any remainder and provides the whole number of players that can achieve the elimination count.
Topic: Iron Man Question: Iron Man is testing his new mini-arc reactors. If each reactor can power his suit for 3 hours and Iron Man wants to go on a mission for 12 hours, how many mini-arc reactors does he need to take with him?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # One mini-arc reactor powers the suit for 3 hours
    power_duration_per_reactor = 3
    # Iron Man wants to go on a mission for 12 hours
    mission_duration = 12
    # The number of mini-arc reactors Iron Man needs is
    reactors_needed = mission_duration / power_duration_per_reactor
    return reactors_needed
```
By dividing the total mission time by the power duration per reactor, we can find out how many reactors Iron Man needs to take with him to last the entire mission.
Topic: unicorns Question: In a magical forest, there are 3 unicorns. Each unicorn has 4 crystals in their mane. One day, they find a treasure chest with 12 additional crystals. They decide to equally share the extra crystals among themselves. How many crystals does each unicorn have now?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Initially, each unicorn has 4 crystals
    initial_crystals_per_unicorn = 4
    # There are 3 unicorns
    number_of_unicorns = 3
    # They find a treasure chest with an additional 12 crystals
    extra_crystals = 12
    # The extra crystals are equally shared among the unicorns
    extra_crystals_per_unicorn = extra_crystals / number_of_unicorns
    # Now, each unicorn has their initial crystals plus their share of the extra crystals
    total_crystals_per_unicorn = initial_crystals_per_unicorn + extra_crystals_per_unicorn
    return total_crystals_per_unicorn

# Calling the function and storing the result
crystals_for_each_unicorn = solution()
print(f"Each unicorn has {crystals_for_each_unicorn} crystals.")
```

This Python function first initializes the number of crystals each unicorn initially has and the number of unicorns. It then adds the additional crystals that are found and divides them equally among the unicorns. Finally, it adds the original number of crystals to the extra amount each unicorn receives.

    # Coins spent at the store
    coins_spent = 30
    # Mario's remaining coins are the total minus what he spent
    remaining_coins = total_coins - coins_spent
    return remaining_coins

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

Executing the function `solution()` will calculate and return the number of coins that Mario has left after collecting coins from the first two levels and then spending some at the store.
Topic: trains Question: Two trains are traveling towards each other on the same track. Train A is traveling at 60 kilometers per hour, and Train B is traveling at 80 kilometers per hour. If they are initially 420 kilometers apart, how long will it take for the two trains to meet?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Speed of Train A
    speed_train_a = 60  # km per hour
    # Speed of Train B
    speed_train_b = 80  # km per hour
    
    # They are initially 420 km apart
    initial_distance = 420  # km
    
    # Since they are traveling towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds
    relative_speed = speed_train_a + speed_train_b  # km per hour
    
    # Time taken for the trains to meet is the initial distance divided by the relative speed
    time_to_meet = initial_distance / relative_speed  # hours
    
    return time_to_meet

# Uncomment next line to test the function
# print(solution())
```
This will calculate how many hours it will take for the two trains to meet by dividing the initial distance by their combined speed.

Topic: Naruto ### Question:
Naruto has been given a secret mission to collect scrolls. On his first day, he found 7 scrolls hidden beneath the Hokage rock. The next day he found three times as many scrolls as on the first day inside the forest of death. On the last day, he found 5 more scrolls in the village marketplace. How many scrolls has Naruto collected in total?

### Solution:
```python
def calculate_scrolls_collected():
    # Scrolls found on the first day beneath the Hokage rock
    first_day_scrolls = 7
    
    # On the next day, he found three times as many as the first day
    second_day_scrolls = first_day_scrolls * 3
    
    # On the last day, he found 5 more scrolls in the village marketplace
    last_day_scrolls = 5
    
    # Total scrolls collected
    total_scrolls = first_day_scrolls + second_day_scrolls + last_day_scrolls
    
    return total_scrolls

# Call the function and print the result
print(calculate_scrolls_collected())
```

This function starts by defining how many scrolls Naruto finds on the first day. It then calculates how many he finds on the second day by tripling the amount from the first day. Lastly, It adds the additional scrolls found on the last day. The function then returns the total number of scrolls that Naruto collected over the three days.
Topic: field hockey ### Question:
A field hockey team has players in three different roles: forwards, midfielders, and defenders. There are 6 forwards, twice as many midfielders as forwards, and half as many defenders as midfielders. How many players are there on the team in total?

### Solution:

```python
def solution():
    # There are 6 forwards on the team
    num_forwards = 6
    
    # There are twice as many midfielders as forwards
    num_midfielders = 2 * num_forwards
    
    # There are half as many defenders as midfielders
    num_defenders = num_midfielders / 2
    
    # The total number of players is the sum of forwards, midfielders, and defenders
    total_players = num_forwards + num_midfielders + num_defenders
    
    # The answer is the total number of players
    return total_players
```

Running the function `solution()` would calculate and return the total number of players on the field hockey team.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Each crane can place 50 steel beams in one hour
    beams_per_crane_per_hour = 50
    # Superman works twice as fast as one crane
    beams_per_superman_per_hour = beams_per_crane_per_hour * 2
    # Number of hours Superman is working
    hours_worked = 3
    # Calculate the total number of beams Superman can place in 3 hours
    total_beams = beams_per_superman_per_hour * hours_worked
    # The answer is
    return total_beams
```

With this Python function, you'll get the number of steel beams Superman can place in 3 hours by calling `solution()`.

An airline operates a small plane that can carry 50 passengers on a single flight. On Monday, the plane made 3 flights and was fully booked for each flight. On Tuesday, the plane made 2 flights, but only 40 seats were occupied on each of those flights. How many passengers did the plane carry in total on Monday and Tuesday?

### Solution:
```python
def passenger_count():
    # The small plane can carry 50 passengers
    max_passengers = 50
    # On Monday, the plane was fully booked for 3 flights
    flights_monday = 3
    # On Tuesday, the plane had 40 seats occupied in 2 flights
    tuesday_passengers = 40
    flights_tuesday = 2
    
    # The total passengers on Monday is
    passengers_monday = max_passengers * flights_monday
    # The total passengers on Tuesday is
    passengers_tuesday = tuesday_passengers * flights_tuesday
    
    # The total passengers on Monday and Tuesday is
    result = passengers_monday + passengers_tuesday
    return result

# Calling the function
total_passengers = passenger_count()
print("The plane carried a total of", total_passengers, "passengers on Monday and Tuesday.")
```

This function calculates the total number of passengers carried by the plane on both Monday and Tuesday by multiplying the number of seats occupied by the number of flights for each day and then adding the two results together.

Simply run the function `total_scoops_sold()` to find out the total number of scoops of ice cream Sally sold.
Topic: Pokémon Question: Ash has 50 Poké Balls in his backpack. He catches 6 new Pikachu, which takes 1 Poké Ball each. Then he trades 3 Pikachu for a rare Charizard, and the Charizard only needs a special Charizard Ball which he already has. How many regular Poké Balls does Ash have left in his backpack?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Ash starts with 50 Poké Balls
    poke_balls_initial = 50
    # He catches 6 Pikachu, using 1 Poké Ball each
    pikachu_caught = 6
    # After catching Pikachu, this is how many Poké Balls he has left
    poke_balls_after_catching = poke_balls_initial - pikachu_caught
    # He trades 3 Pikachu for a Charizard, which doesn't require a new Poké Ball
    # So the number of Poké Balls remains the same after the trade
    # The answer is the number of Poké Balls after catching Pikachu
    result = poke_balls_after_catching
    return result

# Let's test the function to ensure it's working.
print(solution())  # This should output 44.
```
This Python function first calculates the number of Poké Balls Ash has after catching 6 Pikachu by subtracting the number of Pikachu caught from the initial number of Poké Balls. Since trading the Pikachu for a Charizard does not require any additional Poké Balls, the number remains the same. The result represents the number of Poké Balls left.
Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams is playing in a tennis tournament and tracking how many aces she serves each match. In the first match, she serves 8 aces. In the second match, she doubles her aces from the first match. In the third match, she serves 2 fewer aces than in the second match. How many total aces did Serena serve in the three matches?

Solution:
```python
def serena_aces():
    # Serena serves 8 aces in the first match
    first_match_aces = 8
    # She doubles her aces in the second match
    second_match_aces = first_match_aces * 2
    # In the third match, she serves 2 fewer aces than in the second match
    third_match_aces = second_match_aces - 2
    # The total aces Serena serves in the three matches is
    total_aces = first_match_aces + second_match_aces + third_match_aces
    return total_aces

# Call the function to get Serena's total aces
serena_total_aces = serena_aces()
```

When the function is called, `serena_total_aces` will hold the total number of aces Serena served in all three matches.

```python
def solution():
    # The Dragons score 14 goals in the first game
    dragons_first_game = 14
    # The Dragons also score 9 goals in the second game
    dragons_second_game = 9
    # The total goals scored by the Dragons
    total_dragons = dragons_first_game + dragons_second_game
    
    # The Knights score 7 goals in each game
    knights_per_game = 7
    # The total goals scored by the Knights
    total_knights = knights_per_game * 2  # They played two games
    
    # The difference in goals scored by the Dragons and Knights
    result = total_dragons - total_knights
    return result
```

Running the `solution()` function will give us the number of goals that the Dragons scored more than the Knights across the two games.

This example presents a simple arithmetic problem and a Python function that calculates the solution based on the given information. The use of comments in the code explains each step, which is beneficial for educational purposes and understanding the logic behind the solution.
Topic: cats Question: Sarah has 9 cats. She decides to adopt more cats and now has triple the number she started with. How many cats did she adopt?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Sarah started with 9 cats
    initial_cats = 9
    # She now has triple the number of cats
    triple_cats = initial_cats * 3
    # The number of cats she adopted is the difference
    cats_adopted = triple_cats - initial_cats
    return cats_adopted
```
This function calculates the number of cats Sarah adopted by first finding out how many cats she has after tripling her initial amount and then subtracting the initial number of cats from the tripled amount to find the difference, which is the number of cats adopted.
Topic: planes Question: Two planes leave the same airport at the same time. Plane A travels North at a speed of 300 miles per hour, and Plane B travels East at a speed of 400 miles per hour. After 2 hours, how far apart are the two planes?

Solution:
```python
def distance_between_planes():
    #Plane A travels North at 300 mph
    speed_plane_A = 300
    #Plane B travels East at 400 mph
    speed_plane_B = 400
    #They travel for 2 hours
    time_hours = 2
    #Plane A's distance after 2 hours
    distance_A = speed_plane_A * time_hours
    #Plane B's distance after 2 hours
    distance_B = speed_plane_B * time_hours
    # Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the planes
    # The answer is
    distance_apart = (distance_A ** 2 + distance_B ** 2) ** 0.5
    return distance_apart

# Example usage:
print(distance_between_planes())  # This will calculate and print the distance between the two planes
```
The Python function above calculates the distance between two planes that take off simultaneously and head in perpendicular directions. We use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between them after 2 hours of flight.
Topic: Captain Marvel ### Question:
Captain Marvel is helping to organize books in a library. She finds that there are 5 shelves with 28 books each. She then discovers another stack of books with 15 books. If Captain Marvel wants to distribute all the books evenly across the 5 shelves, how many books will be on each shelf?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 5 shelves with 28 books each.
    books_per_shelf = 28
    number_of_shelves = 5
    total_books_initial = books_per_shelf * number_of_shelves
    
    # There is an additional stack of books with 15 books.
    stack_books = 15
    
    # Calculate the new total number of books.
    new_total_books = total_books_initial + stack_books
    
    # Distribute these books evenly across 5 shelves.
    books_on_each_shelf = new_total_books // number_of_shelves
    
    # If there are any remaining books, they would be added to one shelf.
    remaining_books = new_total_books % number_of_shelves
    
    # If we want exactly equal numbers on each shelf, we need to know the number before the last shelf (if any) with remaining books
    if remaining_books > 0:
        print("There will be 1 shelf with {} books and the remaining shelves with {} books each.".format(books_on_each_shelf + remaining_books, books_on_each_shelf))
    else:
        print("Each shelf will have {} books.".format(books_on_each_shelf))
    
    return books_on_each_shelf, remaining_books

solution()
```

In this code, we first calculate the initial total number of books by multiplying the number of books per shelf by the number of shelves. Then we add the extra stack of books to get the new total. We use floor division (`//`) to distribute the books evenly, as we're expecting a whole number of books per shelf. The modulo operation (`%`) is used to determine if there's any remainder. The function then returns both the number of books on each shelf and the remainder. If there's a remainder, the last shelf would have more books than the others.
Topic: field hockey Question: A field hockey team scored 3 goals in the first game of the season. In the second game, they scored twice as many goals as in the first game. If they continue the pattern and score twice as many goals in the third game as they did in the second game, how many goals will they have scored in total by the end of the third game?

Solution:
```python
def total_goals():
    # They scored 3 goals in the first game
    goals_first_game = 3
    # They scored twice as many in the second game, so that's 2 times 3
    goals_second_game = goals_first_game * 2
    # If they score twice as many in the third game, it's 2 times the goals of the second game
    goals_third_game = goals_second_game * 2
    # To find the total, we add up the goals of all three games
    total = goals_first_game + goals_second_game + goals_third_game
    # The answer is the total number of goals scored
    return total

# Calling the function to get result
result = total_goals()
print("The field hockey team will have scored a total of", result, "goals by the end of the third game.")
```

This function, when called, will calculate and return the total number of goals scored by the team over the three games. It uses simple arithmetic operations and demonstrates a geometric progression in the scores.
Topic: ice cream Question: On a sunny day, the Lovely Ice Cream Shop sold ice cream cones to children at the park. They sold 25 vanilla cones, twice as many chocolate cones as vanilla cones, and half as many strawberry cones as chocolate cones. How many ice cream cones in total did they sell that day?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The number of vanilla cones sold
    vanilla_cones = 25
    # Chocolate cones are twice the number of vanilla cones
    chocolate_cones = 2 * vanilla_cones
    # Strawberry cones are half the number of chocolate cones
    strawberry_cones = chocolate_cones // 2  # Using integer division for whole cones
    # The total number of cones is the sum of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry cones
    total_cones = vanilla_cones + chocolate_cones + strawberry_cones
    return total_cones

# Uncommment the line below to test the function
# print(solution())
```

This function first assigns the number of vanilla cones sold to 25, calculates the chocolate cones by doubling that number, and then determines the strawberry cones by halving the chocolate cones. Moving forward, we tally all types of cones to get the total number sold.
Topic: dinosaurs Question: A paleontologist is categorizing dinosaur fossils. She finds that there are 3 Triceratops skulls, each skull has 2 large horns. There are also 4 Velociraptor skulls, but Velociraptors don't have large horns. How many large horns does she have in total?

Solution:
```python
def count_horns():
    # Number of Triceratops skulls
    triceratops_skulls = 3
    # Each Triceratops skull has 2 large horns
    horns_per_triceratops = 2
    # Calculate the total number of large horns
    total_horns = triceratops_skulls * horns_per_triceratops
    # The answer is
    return total_horns

# Call the function to get the result
horn_count = count_horns()
print("The paleontologist has a total of", horn_count, "large horns.")
```

When this function `count_horns` is called, it will calculate the total number of large horns on Triceratops skulls that the paleontologist has found. The Velociraptor skulls are mentioned in the problem to add detail and context, but since they do not have large horns, they do not factor into the calculation.
Topic: Power Rangers ### Question:
The Power Rangers must save the city by defeating a total of 100 monsters. If the Red Ranger defeats 24 monsters, the Blue Ranger defeats 18 monsters, and the Yellow Ranger defeats 22 monsters, how many monsters remain for the Pink and Black Rangers to defeat together?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The total number of monsters
    total_monsters = 100
    # The number of monsters the Red Ranger defeated
    red_ranger_defeated = 24
    # The number of monsters the Blue Ranger defeated
    blue_ranger_defeated = 18
    # The number of monsters the Yellow Ranger defeated
    yellow_ranger_defeated = 22
    # The remaining number of monsters for Pink and Black Rangers
    remaining_monsters = total_monsters - red_ranger_defeated - blue_ranger_defeated - yellow_ranger_defeated
    return remaining_monsters

# Let's call the function to find out how many monsters are left for Pink and Black Rangers
monsters_left = solution()
print(f"The Pink and Black Rangers need to defeat {monsters_left} monsters together.")
```

When we call the `solution()` function, it will return the number of monsters that the Pink and Black Rangers need to defeat together.
Topic: Captain America Question: Captain America is organizing his trading cards. He has 500 cards in total. If he gives 120 cards to Iron Man and trades 70 with Black Widow, how many trading cards will Captain America have left?

```python
def captain_america_cards():
    # Start with total number of cards
    total_cards = 500
    # Cards given to Iron Man
    cards_to_iron_man = 120
    # Cards traded with Black Widow
    cards_traded_black_widow = 70
    # Remaining cards
    remaining_cards = total_cards - (cards_to_iron_man + cards_traded_black_widow)
    return remaining_cards
```

Running the function `captain_america_cards()` would give us the number of trading cards Captain America has after giving some to Iron Man and trading with Black Widow.
Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, is building a new fence around his magical garden to keep out the mischievous trolls. He places a post every 5 feet and needs to enclose a rectangular area that is 50 feet long and 30 feet wide. How many posts does Thor need to put up?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The length of the garden is 50 feet
    length = 50
    # The width of the garden is 30 feet
    width = 30
    # Thor places a post every 5 feet
    post_spacing = 5
    # Calculate the number of posts along the length (we multiply by 2 for both sides)
    posts_length = (length // post_spacing + 1) * 2
    # Calculate the number of posts along the width (we subtract the corner posts because they are already counted in length)
    # and multiply by 2 for both sides
    posts_width = ((width // post_spacing) * 2 - 2)
    # The answer is the sum of the posts along the length and the width
    result = posts_length + posts_width
    return result
```

The solution walks through the steps of determining how many posts are needed for each side and accounts for the doubling of length posts and the reduction of shared corner posts for the width calculation. It then sums the posts required for the length and width to find the total needed to enclose the area.

Topic: basketball Question: The Wildcats basketball team scored a total of 65 points in their last game. The team made a combination of 2-point field goals and 3-point field goals totaling 30 goals. If they scored exactly five more 2-point field goals than 3-point field goals, how many of each type of goal did they score?

Solution:
```python
def basketball_goals():
    # Total points scored
    total_points = 65
    # Total goals made
    total_goals = 30
    # We're told there are five more 2-point field goals than 3-point field goals
    # Let x be the number of 3-point goals, then x + 5 is the number of 2-point goals

    # Each 2-point goal contributes 2 points and each 3-point goal contributes 3 points

    # Setting up equation: 3*x + 2*(x + 5) = total_points
    # Simplify: 3x + 2x + 10 = 65
    # Combine like terms: 5x + 10 = 65
    # Solve for x: 5x = 55
    # Divide by 5: x = 11

    # Number of 3-point goals
    three_point_goals = (total_points - 2 * total_goals) / (3 - 2)

    # Number of 2-point goals is five more than 3-point goals
    two_point_goals = three_point_goals + 5

    return int(two_point_goals), int(three_point_goals)

two_point, three_point = basketball_goals()
print(f"Two-point field goals: {two_point}, Three-point field goals: {three_point}")

Topic: pizza Question: A group of friends ordered 3 large pizzas for their party. Each pizza was cut into 8 equal slices. If each friend ate 2 slices, and there were 6 friends, how many slices of pizza are left?

Solution:
```python
def pizza_left():
    # There were 3 large pizzas
    total_pizzas = 3
    # Each pizza was cut into 8 slices
    slices_per_pizza = 8
    # Total number of slices
    total_slices = total_pizzas * slices_per_pizza
    # There are 6 friends
    friends = 6
    # Each friend ate 2 slices
    slices_per_friend = 2
    # Total number of slices eaten
    slices_eaten = friends * slices_per_friend
    # The answer is the total slices minus the slices eaten
    slices_left = total_slices - slices_eaten
    return slices_left

# Call the function to get the result
print(pizza_left())  # This will print out the number of slices left.
```

In this function, we first calculate the total number of slices available by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza. Then, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend ate. Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices available to determine how many slices are left over.
Topic: ice cream Question: Anna had 32 scoops of ice cream to sell at her ice cream stand. Throughout the day, she sold some scoops of vanilla and twice as many scoops of chocolate. At the end of the day, she had 8 scoops left. How many scoops of vanilla did she sell?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Anna starts with 32 scoops of ice cream
    total_scoops = 32  
    
    # At the end of the day, she has 8 scoops left
    scoops_left = 8
    
    # The scoops she sold are the total scoops minus the scoops left
    scoops_sold = total_scoops - scoops_left
    
    # Let 'v' be the number of vanilla scoops sold
    # Since she sold twice as many chocolate scoops, she sold '2v' chocolate scoops
    # Therefore, scoops_sold = v + 2v 
    # That simplifies to scoops_sold = 3v
    # We solve for 'v' to find the number of vanilla scoops sold
    
    # Solving for 'v'
    vanilla_scoops_sold = scoops_sold / 3
    
    return vanilla_scoops_sold

# Running the function to find the answer
print(solution())
```

The Python function defines the total number of scoops Anna had, calculates the scoops sold by subtracting the scoops left from the total scoops, and then uses algebra to solve for the number of vanilla scoops sold. According to the function, she sold `vanilla_scoops_sold` scoops of vanilla ice cream.

    sarah_money = 20
    
    # Cost of each ice cream cone.
    cone_cost = 3
    
    # Number of friends Sarah is buying ice cream for.
    number_of_friends = 5
    
    # Total cost for the ice cream cones.
    total_cost = cone_cost * number_of_friends
    
    # The change Sarah will receive.
    change = sarah_money - total_cost
    
    return change

# Un-comment the line below to test the function

    bags_of_candy = 5
    # Each bag contains 24 pieces of candy
    pieces_per_bag = 24
    # Calculate the total pieces of candy Jenny has initially
    total_pieces = bags_of_candy * pieces_per_bag
    # Jenny gives 2 friends 12 pieces each
    pieces_given_to_friends = 2 * 12
    # Subtract the pieces given to friends from the total to find the remaining pieces
    remaining_pieces = total_pieces - pieces_given_to_friends
    return remaining_pieces

Topic: cheer leading Question: A cheerleading squad is practicing their routine for the big competition. There are 16 members in the squad. They start by forming 4 equal lines. During a part of the routine, they switch to form 2 equal lines. How many cheerleaders are in each line after they switch?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 16 members in the squad
    squad_members = 16
    # They form 4 equal lines initially
    # Let's calculate how many members per line there are initially
    initial_lines = 4
    members_per_initial_line = squad_members // initial_lines
    # They switch to form 2 equal lines
    new_lines = 2
    # Now we calculate how many members per line there are after the switch
    members_per_new_line = squad_members // new_lines
    # The answer is the number of members per line after the switch
    return members_per_new_line
```

When the squad switches from 4 lines to 2 lines, each new line will have twice as many cheerleaders.
Topic: cars Question: A car manufacturing plant has a target to produce 500 cars every month. In January, they produced 120% of their target. In February, due to a shortage of parts, they only managed to produce 80% of their target. How many cars did they produce over the two months?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The target number of cars to produce each month is 500
    monthly_target = 500
    # In January, they produced 120% of their target
    january_production = monthly_target * 1.2
    # In February, they produced 80% of their target
    february_production = monthly_target * 0.8
    # The total number of cars produced over the two months is
    total_production = january_production + february_production
    return total_production

# Call the function to get the result
total_cars_produced = solution()
print("The car manufacturing plant produced", total_cars_produced, "cars in the first two months.")
```

In this Python function, `monthly_target` represents the number of cars the plant aims to produce each month. The `january_production` calculation uses `1.2` to represent 120% as a decimal multiplier, and the `february_production` uses `0.8` for 80%. The total production is the sum of the car count from both months.
Topic: Harry Potter Question: During a Quidditch match, Harry Potter caught 7 times as many golden snitches as Ron Weasley, who caught just 3 snitches. If Hermione caught 5 more snitches than Harry and Ron combined, how many snitches in total did Hermione catch?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Ron Weasley caught 3 snitches
    snitches_ron = 3
    # Harry caught 7 times as many snitches as Ron
    snitches_harry = 7 * snitches_ron
    # Hermione caught 5 more snitches than Harry and Ron combined
    snitches_hermione = (snitches_harry + snitches_ron) + 5
    return snitches_hermione
```

To find the solution, we first calculate the total number of snitches Harry caught by multiplying Ron's snitches by 7 since Harry caught '7 times as many golden snitches as Ron'. Then, we calculate the total amount of snitches caught by Harry and Ron combined and add 5 to get the total number Hermione caught.
Topic: Batman Question: Batman is chasing Joker through Gotham City. Batman starts his chase with 100 batarangs. During the chase, he uses 13 batarangs to disarm Joker's henchmen and another 8 batarangs to unlock a door. If he finds packs of 5 batarangs along the way, which he picks up, how many batarangs does he need to find to get back to his original count of 100?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Batman starts with 100 batarangs
    batarangs_start = 100
    # He uses 13 batarangs on henchmen
    batarangs_henchmen = 13
    # He uses another 8 batarangs to unlock a door
    batarangs_door = 8
    # He finds packs containing 5 batarangs each
    batarangs_per_pack = 5

    # Calculate the number of batarangs he has after using some
    batarangs_left = batarangs_start - batarangs_henchmen - batarangs_door
    
    # Calculate the number of batarangs he needs to find
    batarangs_needed = batarangs_start - batarangs_left
    
    # Calculate the number of packs he needs to find
    # Assume he can only pick up whole packs and not individual batarangs
    packs_needed = batarangs_needed // batarangs_per_pack
    if batarangs_needed % batarangs_per_pack != 0:
        packs_needed += 1  # If there is a remainder, he needs one more pack

    return packs_needed

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

In this solution, we calculate the number of batarangs Batman has left after using some. Then we calculate how many batarangs he needs to return to his original count. To find out how many packs of 5 batarangs he needs to pick up, we divide the batarangs needed by the number of batarangs in a pack. We use integer division for the packs needed, and if there's a remainder, it means Batman needs one more pack to make up the difference.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Serena has won 4 games in the first set
    games_won_first_set = 4
    # Serena has won 6 games in the second set
    games_won_second_set = 6
    # Serena is ahead by 3 games in the third set
    games_won_third_set = 3
    # Required games to win the third set
    required_games_third_set = 6
    # The number of more games Serena needs to win to achieve 6 games in the third set
    games_needed_to_win = required_games_third_set - games_won_third_set
    
    return games_needed_to_win

# Uncomment the line below to test the function
# print(solution())
```
In the example above, we define and invoke a Python function named `solution` that calculates how many more games Serena Williams needs to win to clinch the third set in a tennis match. The function provides a step-by-step solution to the word problem provided.
Topic: cars Question: There are three colors of cars in a parking lot: red, blue, and green. There are 24 red cars, 17 blue cars, and the rest are green cars. If there are 60 cars in the parking lot in total, how many cars are green?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The total number of cars in the parking lot
    total_cars = 60
    # The number of red cars
    red_cars = 24
    # The number of blue cars
    blue_cars = 17
    # The number of green cars is the total minus the number of red and blue cars
    green_cars = total_cars - red_cars - blue_cars
    return green_cars

# Uncomment the following line to test the function:
# print(solution())
```

This function calculates the number of green cars by subtracting the number of red and blue cars from the total count.
Topic: Superman Question: Superman helps a construction crew by moving bricks. He needs to move 500 bricks from one side of the construction site to the other. If Superman can carry 50 bricks in each trip, how many trips does Superman need to make to move all the bricks?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of bricks Superman needs to move
    total_bricks = 500
    # Number of bricks Superman can carry per trip
    bricks_per_trip = 50
    # Calculating the number of trips
    # The answer is the total bricks divided by the number of bricks per trip
    trips = total_bricks / bricks_per_trip
    return trips
```
Note: If you are looking for an integer number of trips and considering that Superman may not be able to carry a fraction of a brick, you would use integer division with floor rounding in Python, which is represented by `//`.

Example with integer division:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of bricks Superman needs to move
    total_bricks = 500
    # Number of bricks Superman can carry per trip
    bricks_per_trip = 50
    # Calculating the number of trips using integer division
    trips = total_bricks // bricks_per_trip
    return trips
```
Topic: trains Question: At the train station, there are two trains getting ready to leave. Train A has 8 carriages and each carriage can seat 48 passengers. Train B is twice as long as Train A and each carriage can seat 36 passengers. How many passengers can be seated on both trains?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Train A has 8 carriages
    carriages_train_A = 8
    # Each carriage of Train A can seat 48 passengers
    seating_capacity_train_A = 48
    # Train B is twice as long as Train A, so it has 8*2 carriages
    carriages_train_B = carriages_train_A * 2
    # Each carriage of Train B can seat 36 passengers
    seating_capacity_train_B = 36
    # The passenger capacity of Train A is
    passengers_train_A = carriages_train_A * seating_capacity_train_A
    # The passenger capacity of Train B is
    passengers_train_B = carriages_train_B * seating_capacity_train_B
    # The total passenger capacity for both trains is
    result = passengers_train_A + passengers_train_B
    return result

# Let's call the function to see how many passengers can be seated on both trains.
total_passengers = solution()
print("The total number of passengers that can be seated on both trains is:", total_passengers)
```

By running this function, you would get the total number of passengers that can be seated on both Train A and Train B combined.
Topic: Hello Kitty Question: Hello Kitty is having a tea party and she's inviting her friends. She invites 4 friends from school and twice as many from her neighborhood. If each friend brings along 3 sweets to share, how many sweets will be at the tea party in total?

Solution:
```python
def total_sweets():
    # Number of friends invited from school
    school_friends = 4
    # Twice as many friends are invited from the neighborhood
    neighborhood_friends = 2 * school_friends
    # Each friend brings 3 sweets
    sweets_per_friend = 3
    # Total friends invited
    total_friends = school_friends + neighborhood_friends
    # Total sweets at the party
    total_sweets = total_friends * sweets_per_friend
    return total_sweets

# Calling the function to get the result
print(total_sweets())  # This line would output the total number of sweets at the tea party if the function is run
```

### Explanation:
1. Compute the number of neighborhood friends by doubling the school friends, which is `4 * 2 = 8`.
2. Add the school friends and neighborhood friends to get the total number of friends, which is `4 + 8 = 12`.
3. Each friend brings 3 sweets, so multiply the total number of friends by 3 to get the total sweets, which is `12 * 3 = 36`.
4. `total_sweets()` returns `36` as the total number of sweets at the tea party.
Topic: Hello Kitty Question: Hello Kitty has 5 apples. Her friend, Mimmy, has twice as many apples as Hello Kitty. Her other friend, Keroppi, has 6 fewer apples than Mimmy. How many apples do they have together?

Solution:
```python

    # Hello Kitty has 5 apples
    hello_kitty_apples = 5
    # Mimmy has twice as many apples as Hello Kitty
    mimmy_apples = hello_kitty_apples * 2
    # Keroppi has 6 fewer apples than Mimmy
    keroppi_apples = mimmy_apples - 6
    # The total number of apples is
    total_apples = hello_kitty_apples + mimmy_apples + keroppi_apples
    return total_apples
```

From airport B, 4 planes take off in the morning and 10 planes take off in the evening. How many planes have taken off from both airports by the end of the day?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    #From airport A, 8 planes take off in the morning
    morning_takeoffs_A = 8
    #From airport A, 5 more planes take off in the evening
    evening_takeoffs_A = 5
    #From airport B, 4 planes take off in the morning
    morning_takeoffs_B = 4
    #From airport B, 10 planes take off in the evening
    evening_takeoffs_B = 10
    #Total planes taking off from airport A
    total_takeoffs_A = morning_takeoffs_A + evening_takeoffs_A
    #Total planes taking off from airport B
    total_takeoffs_B = morning_takeoffs_B + evening_takeoffs_B
    #Total planes that have taken off from both airports by the end of the day
    result = total_takeoffs_A + total_takeoffs_B
    return result
```
This Python function calculates the total number of plane takeoffs from both airports by adding together the morning and evening takeoffs from each airport and then summing them up.
Topic: Power Rangers Question: The Power Rangers are teaming up to defeat the space witch Rita Repulsa. If each Ranger can deal 5 damage and there are 5 Rangers, but during the battle they get infused with energy and triple their damage, how much damage can they deal in total now?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Each Power Ranger can deal 5 damage
    damage_per_ranger = 5
    
    # There are 5 Power Rangers
    number_of_rangers = 5
    
    # Initially, the total damage without the energy infusion is
    initial_total_damage = damage_per_ranger * number_of_rangers
    
    # But their damage triples due to the energy infusion
    infusion_multiplier = 3
    
    # Now, the total damage after the energy infusion is
    infused_total_damage = initial_total_damage * infusion_multiplier
    
    return infused_total_damage

# To solve the word problem, we would call the function
print(solution())  # This will print the total damage the Power Rangers can deal after the energy infusion
```

When the above Python function `solution()` is run, it will calculate the total increased damage the Power Rangers can deal after receiving their energy infusion. The calculation takes the original damage per Ranger, multiplies it by the number of Rangers to get the initial total damage, and then multiplies it again by 3 after their damage output is tripled. The result is the total infused damage they can deal to defeat Rita Repulsa.
Topic: unicorns Question: In a magical forest, there are 9 unicorns. Each unicorn has 3 times as many rainbow sparkles as the number of unicorns. How many rainbow sparkles are there in total?

Solution:
```python

def solution():
    # Each touchdown is worth 6 points
    points_per_touchdown = 6
    # The team scored 4 touchdowns
    total_touchdowns = 4
    # Each field goal is worth 3 points
    points_per_field_goal = 3
    # The team scored 3 field goals
    total_field_goals = 3
    
    # Total points for touchdowns is touchdowns * points per touchdown
    total_points_touchdowns = total_touchdowns * points_per_touchdown
    # Total points for field goals is field goals * points per field goal
    total_points_field_goals = total_field_goals * points_per_field_goal
    
    # The total score is the sum of points from touchdowns and field goals
    total_score = total_points_touchdowns + total_points_field_goals
    return total_score

# Uncomment the line below to test the function
# print(solution())  # Expected output: 39
```

When we call the `solution()` function, it will calculate the total score for the team in the first half of the game based on the given touchdowns and field goals.

    # Remaining blocks after building crafting table and chest
    remaining_blocks = wood_blocks - used_blocks

    # She can make 4 sticks from one block of wood
    sticks_per_block = 4
    sticks_from_remaining_blocks = remaining_blocks * sticks_per_block

    # Each ladder requires 7 sticks
    sticks_per_ladder = 7

    # The number of ladders Alex can build is the total sticks divided by sticks per ladder
    number_of_ladders = sticks_from_remaining_blocks // sticks_per_ladder

Topic: Wonder Woman Question: Wonder Woman is helping to distribute school supplies. She has 48 pencils, 36 notebooks, and 24 erasers. She wants to create the same number of sets of supplies, where each set has the same number of each type of supply without any leftovers. What is the largest number of sets she can make?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Wonder Woman has 48 pencils, 36 notebooks, and 24 erasers.
    pencils = 48
    notebooks = 36
    erasers = 24
    
    # To find the largest number of sets she can make with no leftover, 
    # we need to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the supplies count.
    # This function calculates the GCD of two numbers.
    def find_gcd(x, y):
        while(y):
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x
    
    # Calculate GCD of pencils and notebooks
    gcd_1 = find_gcd(pencils, notebooks)
    
    # Using the GCD of pencils and notebooks, find GCD with the count of erasers
    gcd_final = find_gcd(gcd_1, erasers)
    
    # The result is the GCD which is the largest number of sets without leftovers
    return gcd_final

# Call the function to get the result
sets = solution()
print(f"The largest number of sets Wonder Woman can make is: {sets}")
```

When this function is executed, it will find the greatest number of sets that Wonder Woman can make with the supplies she has, ensuring each set has the same number of pencils, notebooks, and erasers without any supplies left over.
Topic: Captain Marvel Question: Captain Marvel is helping to relocate families from an endangered planet. She can carry 25 people per trip. If there are 175 people on the planet, how many trips does Captain Marvel need to make to evacuate everyone?

Solution:
```python
def captain_marvel_trips():
    # Number of people Captain Marvel needs to evacuate
    total_people = 175
    # Number of people she can carry per trip
    people_per_trip = 25
    
    # Calculate the number of trips needed by dividing
    # the total number of people by the number of people per trip.
    # The answer needs to be rounded up because you can't have a fraction of a trip.
    # So we use the ceil function from the math module to round up the number.
    from math import ceil
    trips_needed = ceil(total_people / people_per_trip)
    
    # The answer is:
    result = trips_needed
    return result

# Uncomment the line below to test the function:
# print(captain_marvel_trips())
```
In this problem, the students learn to divide numbers and round up to the nearest whole number, as you can't have a fraction of a trip in a real-world scenario. This introduces them to practical applications of division and the concept of rounding up, which is handled by the `ceil` function from the Python `math` module.
Topic: pizza Question: A pizza restaurant made 180 pizzas on a Friday. There were three types of pizzas made: pepperoni, vegetarian, and cheese. If they made twice as many pepperoni pizzas as vegetarian pizzas, and 30 cheese pizzas, how many pepperoni and vegetarian pizzas did they make?

Solution:
```python
def pizza_problem():
    # Total number of pizzas made
    total_pizzas = 180
    # Number of cheese pizzas made
    cheese_pizzas = 30
    # Let's denote the number of vegetarian pizzas as x
    # Then, the number of pepperoni pizzas will be 2 times x, i.e., 2x
    # According to the information given:
    # cheese_pizzas + x + 2x = total_pizzas
    # From this equation, we can solve for x, which is the number of vegetarian pizzas
    vegetarian_pizzas = (total_pizzas - cheese_pizzas) // 3
    # Number of pepperoni pizzas is twice the number of vegetarian pizzas
    pepperoni_pizzas = 2 * vegetarian_pizzas
    # The answer is
    return pepperoni_pizzas, vegetarian_pizzas

# Compute the result
pepperoni, vegetarian = pizza_problem()
print(f"Pepperoni Pizzas: {pepperoni}, Vegetarian Pizzas: {vegetarian}")
```

This function calculates the number of pepperoni and vegetarian pizzas made by the restaurant on that Friday by using the given ratio of their quantities and the fixed number of cheese pizzas.
Topic: cats Question: In one neighborhood, there are 8 houses. Each house has the same number of cats. If there are a total of 24 cats in the neighborhood, how many cats are there in each house?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of cats in the neighborhood
    total_cats = 24
    # Number of houses in the neighborhood
    houses = 8
    # Cats per house
    cats_per_house = total_cats / houses
    # The answer is
    return cats_per_house
```

If you run this Python function, it will calculate and return how many cats are there in each of the 8 houses.
Topic: Naruto **Question**: Naruto is training to improve his chakra control. He practices 3 different exercises every day. If he spends 15 minutes on each exercise and he trains for 10 days, how many minutes in total will Naruto have trained?

**Solution**:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of exercises Naruto practices each day
    exercises_per_day = 3
    # Minutes spent on each exercise
    minutes_per_exercise = 15
    # Number of days Naruto trains
    training_days = 10
    # Total training time is calculated by multiplying exercises per day,
    # minutes per exercise, and training days.
    total_training_minutes = exercises_per_day * minutes_per_exercise * training_days
    return total_training_minutes

# Now, let's call the function and print the solution.
print(solution())
```
When executed, this Python function will calculate and return the total number of minutes that Naruto has trained over the 10 days.
Topic: Minecraft Question: In Minecraft, a player is building a rectangular fence around their garden. The player has placed 20 blocks along the length and 14 blocks along the width. If the player wants to place torches on every second block of the fence to keep mobs away, how many torches does the player need?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The number of blocks along the length of the fence
    length = 20
    # The number of blocks along the width of the fence
    width = 14
    # Calculating the total perimeter of the fence
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    # Since torches are placed on every second block
    # we divide the perimeter by 2 to find the number of torches
    num_torches = perimeter // 2
    # Note that we use floor division because you can't place half a torch
    return num_torches

# Now let's call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This code will calculate how many torches the player needs to place on a fence with the given dimensions, assuming a torch is placed on every second block. The "//" operator is used for floor division to ensure we get an integer number of torches since it is not possible to place a fractional part of a torch.
Topic: Power Rangers ### Response:
Question: The Power Rangers are trying to save the city from a monster attack.  The Red Ranger has subdued 15 monsters, the Blue Ranger has subdued twice as many as the Yellow Ranger who has subdued 8. The Pink Ranger has subdued half the number of monsters that the Red Ranger has. If the Black Ranger subdued 13 monsters, how many monsters have the Power Rangers subdued in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The Red Ranger has subdued 15 monsters
    red_ranger_monsters = 15
    # The Yellow Ranger has subdued 8 monsters
    yellow_ranger_monsters = 8
    # The Blue Ranger has subdued twice as many as the Yellow Ranger
    blue_ranger_monsters = yellow_ranger_monsters * 2
    # The Pink Ranger has subdued half the number of monsters that the Red Ranger has
    pink_ranger_monsters = red_ranger_monsters / 2
    # The Black Ranger has subdued 13 monsters
    black_ranger_monsters = 13
    # The total number of monsters subdued by all Power Rangers is
    total_monsters_subdued = (red_ranger_monsters + blue_ranger_monsters +
                              yellow_ranger_monsters + pink_ranger_monsters +
                              black_ranger_monsters)
    # The answer is
    return total_monsters_subdued
```

Running the `solution()` function will give us the total number of monsters the Power Rangers have subdued.
Topic: soccer Question: A soccer team scored 3 goals in the first match, doubled their goal count in the second match, and then scored half as many in the third match as they did in the second match. If they play one more match and score 2 more goals than in the third match, how many goals will they have scored in total by the end of the fourth match?

Solution:
```python
def total_goals():
    # Goals scored in the first match
    first_match_goals = 3
    
    # They doubled their goal count in the second match
    second_match_goals = first_match_goals * 2
    
    # Scored half as many in the third match as in the second match
    third_match_goals = second_match_goals / 2
    
    # If they score 2 more goals than in the third match in the fourth match
    fourth_match_goals = third_match_goals + 2
    
    # The total goals scored is
    total = first_match_goals + second_match_goals + third_match_goals + fourth_match_goals
    return total

# Call the function and print the result
print(total_goals())
```

The step-by-step comments in the function explain how the problem is broken down into variables representing the number of goals scored in each match. The function then adds up these goals to determine the total number of goals scored by the end of the fourth match.
Topic: Super Mario Question: Super Mario collects coins as he travels through the Mushroom Kingdom. He starts his journey with 5 coins. In the first world, he collects 20 coins. In the second world, he loses 10 coins to Goombas. Then in the third world, he hits a block that doubles his total coins. How many coins does Super Mario have after the third world?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Super Mario starts with 5 coins
    initial_coins = 5
    # In the first world, he collects 20 coins
    first_world_coins = 20
    # In the second world, he loses 10 coins to Goombas
    second_world_coins = -10 # Negative because he loses coins
    # Now calculate the total before the third world
    before_third_world = initial_coins + first_world_coins + second_world_coins
    # In the third world, his coins are doubled
    third_world_coins = before_third_world * 2
    # The answer is the total after the third world
    return third_world_coins

# Call the function to get the result
result = solution()
print(f"Super Mario has {result} coins after the third world.")
```
This function computes the number of coins Super Mario has at each world, considering the coins he collects and loses, and applies the doubling he receives in the third world, returning the total number of coins.
Topic: Spiderman ### Question:
Spiderman is helping to clean up the city. For his cleanup campaign, he collects 100 pieces of litter on Monday and twice that amount on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he collects 50 more pieces of litter than on Tuesday. How many pieces of litter has Spiderman collected over these three days?

### Solution:
```python
def litter_collection():
    # Spiderman collected 100 pieces of litter on Monday
    monday_litter = 100
    
    # On Tuesday, he collected twice the amount he did on Monday
    tuesday_litter = 2 * monday_litter
    
    # On Wednesday, he collected 50 more pieces than he did on Tuesday
    wednesday_litter = tuesday_litter + 50
    
    # Add up the litter collected over the three days
    total_litter_collected = monday_litter + tuesday_litter + wednesday_litter
    
    # The answer is the total amount of litter
    return total_litter_collected

# Call the function to find out the result
total_litter = litter_collection()
```

By running this Python function, we can determine the total amount of litter that Spiderman collected over the three days.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Batman captures 4 henchmen each night
    henchmen_captured_per_night = 4
    # Number of nights Batman goes on the mission
    nights = 5
    # Henchmen captured in total
    total_henchmen_captured = henchmen_captured_per_night * nights
    # Henchmen escaping each day
    henchmen_escape_per_day = 2
    # Total henchmen escaped after 5 days
    # Assuming the escape happens after each night's capture action
    total_henchmen_escaped = henchmen_escape_per_day * nights
    # The answer is
    result = total_henchmen_captured - total_henchmen_escaped
    return result

# Call the function and print the result
captured_henchmen = solution()
print(f"Batman has {captured_henchmen} henchmen captured after 5 days.")
```
This Python function calculates the total number of henchmen captured after 5 nights of Batman's mission, accounting for the escapes that occur during the day.
Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams played 3 tennis matches. In the first match, she scored a total of 15 aces. In the second match, she did twice as well as the first match. However, in the third match, she scored 5 fewer aces than she did in the second match. How many aces did Serena score in total in the three matches?

Solution:
```python
def serena_aces():
    # Serena scored 15 aces in the first match
    first_match_aces = 15
    # She scored twice the number of aces in the second match
    second_match_aces = 2 * first_match_aces
    # She scored 5 fewer aces than the second match in the third match
    third_match_aces = second_match_aces - 5
    # The total number of aces in all three matches is the sum of aces from each match
    total_aces = first_match_aces + second_match_aces + third_match_aces
    # The answer is
    return total_aces

# Now, we can call the function to get the total number of aces
total_aces_scored = serena_aces()
```

Running the `serena_aces()` function would return the total number of aces Serena scored in the three matches.

    takeoffs_runway2 = 12
    # Runway 2 had 16 landings
    landings_runway2 = 16
    
    # Add takeoffs and landings for Runway 1
    total_runway1 = takeoffs_runway1 + landings_runway1
    
    # Add takeoffs and landings for Runway 2
    total_runway2 = takeoffs_runway2 + landings_runway2
    
    # The answer is the sum of the total for Runway 1 and Runway 2
    result = total_runway1 + total_runway2
    
    return result

# Call the function to get the total takeoffs and landings
total_traffic = airport_traffic()
```

By running the `airport_traffic()` function, we would get the total count of takeoffs and landings that occurred at the airport on that day.

    # He carries 300 books each trip
    books_per_trip = 300
    # On the last trip, an additional 200 books are given
    additional_books = 200
    # The total books moved are the books per trip times the number of trips
    # plus the additional books
    total_books_moved = (books_per_trip * (trips - 1)) + (books_per_trip + additional_books)
    # The final answer is
    return total_books_moved

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This Python function calculates the total number of books Superman moves by multiplying the number of books per trip by one less than the total number of trips (since the last trip includes extra books), and then adds the books from the last trip and the additional donated books.

However, due to special arrangements and stage design, only 85% of the available seats can be used at each venue. How many fans in total can attend Taylor Swift's concerts across the country?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of concerts
    concerts = 30
    # Each concert venue's capacity
    venue_capacity = 12000
    # Only 85% of the available seats can be used
    usable_seats_percentage = 0.85
    # Usable seats at each venue
    usable_seats = venue_capacity * usable_seats_percentage
    # Total number of fans who can attend
    total_fans = concerts * usable_seats
    return total_fans
```

This Python function assumes that the initial setup of the problem (number of concerts, venue capacity, and the percentage of usable seats) are constant and simply calculates the total number of fans who are able to attend Taylor Swift's concerts based on these numbers.
Topic: dinosaurs Question: Dr. Dino, a paleontologist, found a cache of dinosaur bones. In one area, he found 47 Stegosaurus bones and twice as many Triceratops bones. How many dinosaur bones did Dr. Dino find in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Dr. Dino found 47 Stegosaurus bones
    stegosaurus_bones = 47
    # He found twice as many Triceratops bones
    triceratops_bones = 2 * stegosaurus_bones
    # The total number of bones found is the sum
    total_bones = stegosaurus_bones + triceratops_bones
    return total_bones

# Uncomment the following to run the solution function and print the result

```

When this function is executed, it will calculate the total number of dinosaur bones Dr. Dino found by adding the number of Stegosaurus bones to twice that number for the Triceratops bones, and then return the result.
Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams has won a certain number of tennis matches this season. If she wins 8 more matches, she will double the number she has won so far. How many matches has Serena won this season?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Let x be the number of matches Serena has won so far.
    # If Serena wins 8 more matches, she will have won x + 8 matches.
    # This will also be twice the number she has won so far, which is 2 * x.
    # Therefore, the equation is x + 8 = 2 * x.
  
    # Rearrange the equation to solve for x.
    # Subtract x from both sides of the equation to get 8 = x
    # The answer is
    serena_wins = 8
    return serena_wins

# You can test the function with the following line:
# print(solution())
```

Note: The word problem implies a simple equation, x + 8 = 2x, which simplifies to x = 8. Thus, Serena has won 8 matches this season before any additional matches.

At a regional cheerleading competition, the Sparkling Stars squad is divided into groups for different routines. There are 4 groups. The first group has 5 cheerleaders, the second group has 7 cheerleaders, the third group has 8 cheerleaders, and the fourth group is supposed to have an equal number of cheerleaders as the total from the first three groups combined. How many cheerleaders will there be in the fourth group?

#### Solution:
```python
def cheerleaders_in_fourth_group():
    # First group has 5 cheerleaders
    first_group = 5
    
    # Second group has 7 cheerleaders
    second_group = 7
    
    # Third group has 8 cheerleaders
    third_group = 8
    
    # The fourth group should have as many cheerleaders as the sum of the first three groups
    fourth_group = first_group + second_group + third_group
    
    return fourth_group

# Call the function and print the result
print(cheerleaders_in_fourth_group())
```

When you run the function, it will calculate and return the number of cheerleaders in the fourth group based on the numbers from the first three groups.
Topic: Minecraft Question: In Minecraft, Alex has mined 24 blocks of iron ore, 18 blocks of coal, and 42 blocks of redstone. She wants to evenly distribute these blocks among her 3 chests. How many blocks of each type will go into each chest?

Solution:
```python
def distribute_blocks():
    # Alex has mined 24 blocks of iron ore, 18 blocks of coal, and 42 blocks of redstone
    iron_ore_blocks = 24
    coal_blocks = 18
    redstone_blocks = 42
    
    # She wants to distribute these blocks among her 3 chests
    number_of_chests = 3
    
    # The number of iron ore blocks per chest is
    iron_ore_per_chest = iron_ore_blocks / number_of_chests
    
    # The number of coal blocks per chest is
    coal_per_chest = coal_blocks / number_of_chests
    
    # The number of redstone blocks per chest is
    redstone_per_chest = redstone_blocks / number_of_chests
    
    # The answer is the number of blocks of each type for one chest
    result = (iron_ore_per_chest, coal_per_chest, redstone_per_chest)
    return result

# Let's call the function and print the results
blocks_per_chest = distribute_blocks()
print(f'Iron ore per chest: {blocks_per_chest[0]}')
print(f'Coal per chest: {blocks_per_chest[1]}')
print(f'Redstone per chest: {blocks_per_chest[2]}')
```

When we run this function, it will return a tuple with the number of blocks of iron ore, coal, and redstone that will go into each chest. Then, it prints out this information for each type of block.

Topic: Fortnite Question: In a game of Fortnite, Alex found 3 treasure chests in the first round, each containing 20 health points worth of potions. In the second round, she found 2 more chests, but these only contained 15 health points worth of potions each. If she started the game with 100 health points, and did not lose any health, what is her total health points after collecting all the potions?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Alex starts with 100 health points
    starting_health = 100
    
    # Each chest in the first round contains 20 health points
    first_round_chests = 3
    health_per_first_round_chest = 20
    # Total health points from the first round
    first_round_health = first_round_chests * health_per_first_round_chest
    
    # Each chest in the second round contains 15 health points
    second_round_chests = 2
    health_per_second_round_chest = 15
    # Total health points from the second round
    second_round_health = second_round_chests * health_per_second_round_chest
    
    # Compute the total health points after collecting all the potions
    total_health = starting_health + first_round_health + second_round_health
    
    # The answer is
    return total_health

# Let's call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

Note: This problem assumes that health points can exceed 100, which is not typical in many games, including Fortnite. However, for the purposes of a grade school math problem, such simplification is acceptable to teach basic arithmetic.

Solution:
```python
def remaining_cats():
    # Jenny starts with 12 adult cats
    adult_cats_initial = 12
    # Each adult cat has 3 kittens
    kittens_per_cat = 3
    
    # Total number of kittens is the number of adult cats times the number of kittens per cat
    total_kittens = adult_cats_initial * kittens_per_cat
    # Total number of cats initially is the sum of adult cats and kittens
    total_cats_initial = adult_cats_initial + total_kittens
    
    # Jenny gives away 4 adult cats
    adult_cats_given_away = 4
    # Jenny also gives away the kittens of the adult cats
    kittens_given_away = adult_cats_given_away * kittens_per_cat
    
    # Total number of cats given away is the sum of adult cats given away and their kittens
    total_cats_given_away = adult_cats_given_away + kittens_given_away
    # The answer is the initial number of cats minus the number given away
    result = total_cats_initial - total_cats_given_away
    return result

# Call the function and print the result
print(remaining_cats())
```
This Python function calculates the total number of cats Jenny has left after giving away 4 adult cats and their kittens.

Topic: unicorns Question: In the Enchanted Forest, there is a herd of unicorns. If the number of adult unicorns is triple the number of baby unicorns and there are a total of 40 unicorns, how many adult unicorns and how many baby unicorns are there?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of unicorns
    total_unicorns = 40
    # Let baby_unicorns represent the number of baby unicorns
    # Since adult_unicorns are triple the baby_unicorns, we represent them as 3 * baby_unicorns
    # Total is baby_unicorns + adult_unicorns which is baby_unicorns + 3 * baby_unicorns
    # 4 * baby_unicorns = total_unicorns therefore baby_unicorns = total_unicorns / 4
    baby_unicorns = total_unicorns / 4
    # Adult unicorns are triple the number of baby unicorns
    adult_unicorns = 3 * baby_unicorns
    return adult_unicorns, baby_unicorns

# Let's call the function and print the results
adults, babies = solution()

Topic: soccer Question: A soccer coach divides the players into equal groups for a drill. If there are 18 players in total and each group needs to have the same number of players without any player left out, what is the largest number of players that can be in each group?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # There are 18 players in total
    total_players = 18
    # We have to find the largest number that divides 18 without leaving a remainder
    # We can start from the half of the total number, since the largest possible group can't be more than half
    largest_group_size = total_players // 2
    
    # We decrement group size by 1 and check if it divides 18 evenly until we find the largest possible group size
    while total_players % largest_group_size != 0:
        largest_group_size -= 1
        
    # The answer is the largest group size with no players left out
    return largest_group_size

# To use the function, we call it like this:
group_size = solution()
print("The largest number of players in each group is:", group_size)
```

Commented out, the solution to the math problem would be written within the Python code as shown above, and it would solve for the largest number of players that can be in each group without leaving anyone out.

Topic: trains Question: Train A leaves the station heading west at 3:00 PM traveling at 60 miles per hour. Two hours later, Train B leaves the same station heading west on a parallel track at 75 miles per hour. At what time will Train B catch up to Train A?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Train A leaves at 3:00 PM at 60 mph
    speed_train_a = 60
    departure_time_a = 3  # in PM

    # Train B leaves at 5:00 PM (2 hours later) at 75 mph
    speed_train_b = 75
    departure_time_b = 5  # in PM
    
    # By the time Train B leaves, Train A is already 2 hours ahead
    # Distance = Speed * Time, so Train A has covered:
    distance_a = 2 * speed_train_a
    
    # Time taken for Train B to catch up to Train A can be found by setting their distances equal:
    # speed_train_a * time = distance_a + speed_train_b * time
    # We then solve for time, where time represents the number of hours after Train B departs:
    # (speed_train_b - speed_train_a) * time = distance_a
    time = distance_a / (speed_train_b - speed_train_a)
    
    # To find the catch up time, we add this time to Train B's departure time:
    catch_up_time = departure_time_b + time
    
    # If the catch up time is greater than 12, we convert it to standard time format (PM)
    if catch_up_time > 12:
        catch_up_time -= 12  # Convert to PM
    catch_up_time_str = f"{int(catch_up_time)}:{int((catch_up_time % 1) * 60):02d} PM"

    return catch_up_time_str

# Uncomment the below line to check the answer.
# print(solution())
```

Executing the above function would give you the time at which Train B will catch up to Train A in the format of hours:minutes PM.
Topic: ice cream Question: Sarah went to an ice cream shop where she bought ice cream cones for her 3 friends. Each cone costs $2. She also bought herself a double scoop that costs an additional $1.50 more than a regular cone. How much did she spend in total for the ice cream?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Cost for one ice cream cone
    cone_cost = 2
    # Number of friends
    friends = 3
    # Total cost for friends' ice cream cones
    friends_ice_cream_cost = cone_cost * friends
    
    # Additional cost for a double scoop
    double_scoop_additional_cost = 1.5
    # Total cost for Sarah's double scoop ice cream
    sarah_ice_cream_cost = cone_cost + double_scoop_additional_cost
    
    # Total cost spent in the ice cream shop
    total_cost = friends_ice_cream_cost + sarah_ice_cream_cost
    return total_cost

# Call the function to get the result
print(solution())
```
This function first computes the total cost for Sarah's friends' cones by multiplying the cost of a single cone by the number of friends. Then, it calculates the total cost for Sarah's double scoop by adding the additional cost to the regular cone cost. Finally, it sums up both amounts to get the total cost spent on ice cream.

    # The quarterback throws for a total of 350 yards
    total_yards = 350
    # He completes 15 short passes
    short_passes = 15
    # Each short pass gains an average of 6 yards
    average_short_pass_yards = 6
    # Total yards gained from short passes is
    total_short_pass_yards = short_passes * average_short_pass_yards
    # The yards gained from long passes is
    long_pass_yards = total_yards - total_short_pass_yards
    return long_pass_yards

# Uncomment the following to test the function

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Tommy starts with 50 pieces of gum
    gum = 50
    # 30 pieces of chocolate
    chocolate = 30
    # And 20 pieces of licorice
    licorice = 20
    # He gave away 15 pieces of gum
    gum_given_away = 15
    # And 5 pieces of chocolate
    chocolate_given_away = 5
    # The total candy left is the original counts minus what he gave away
    total_candy_left = (gum - gum_given_away) + (chocolate - chocolate_given_away) + licorice
    return total_candy_left

# Now we will call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This Python function calculates the total number of candies left after Tommy gives some away. Initially, we have separate counts for gum, chocolate, and licorice. We subtract the number of pieces given away from the respective initial counts and sum up the remaining candies to get the total. The function then returns this total number of candies left.

    # The coach starts with 50 lacrosse balls
    initial_balls = 50
    # There are 5 practice stations
    stations = 5
    # Each station gets an equal number of balls
    balls_per_station = initial_balls / stations
    # 2 stations lose 3 balls each
    lost_balls = 2 * 3
    # Subtract the lost balls from the initial total
    remaining_balls = initial_balls - lost_balls
    # The answer is
    result = remaining_balls
    return result
```

Using this function, we can determine how many lacrosse balls remain after the practice stations lose some of them.

Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams has won 3 out of her last 4 tennis matches. If she wins the next match, her win ratio will be 80%. How many matches has she played so far?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Serena has won 3 out of her last 4 matches, so she has played 4 matches.
    matches_played_so_far = 4
    # If she wins the next match, her total wins will be 4.
    projected_wins = 3 + 1
    # To find the total number of matches to have an 80% win ratio,
    # the equation is: (projected_wins / total_matches) = 0.80
    # We know projected_wins = 4, so:
    # (4 / total_matches) = 0.80
    # Solving for total_matches gives us 5 (because 4/5 = 0.80).
    total_matches = projected_wins / 0.80
    # The current number of matches played is total_matches - 1 (since she hasn't played the next match yet)
    current_matches_played = total_matches - 1
    return int(current_matches_played)
```

This function calculates the number of matches Serena has played so far. After setting up the initial number of matches played and wins, we added the projected win if she wins the next match to calculate the total future matches by using her target win ratio. We subtract one to find the number of matches she has played at present.

    # Serena's score for the first match
    first_match_score = 6 + 6  # She won two sets with these scores
    # Serena's score for the second match
    second_match_score = 7 + 6  # She won two sets with these scores
    # Serena's score for the third match
    third_match_first_set = 6  # She won the first set
    third_match_second_set = 3  # She lost the second set
    third_match_third_set = 6  # She won the final set
    # The total number of games Serena won
    total_games_won = first_match_score + second_match_score + third_match_first_set + third_match_second_set + third_match_third_set
    return total_games_won

# Uncomment the line below to test the function
# print(solution())
```

Topic: ice cream Question: Lisa has a small ice cream shop and sells 3 flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. She sold 120 scoops of ice cream on Monday. If chocolate scoops were twice as many as vanilla scoops and strawberry scoops were 10 less than vanilla, how many scoops of each flavor did she sell?

Solution:
```python
def calculate_scoops_sold():
    # Total scoops sold on Monday
    total_scoops = 120
    
    # Let's denote the number of vanilla scoops as 'v'
    # According to the problem:
    # Chocolate scoops = 2 * vanilla scoops = 2v
    # Strawberry scoops = vanilla scoops - 10 = v - 10
    # Total scoops = vanilla + chocolate + strawberry = v + 2v + v - 10 = 120
    
    # Simplify the equation:
    # 4v - 10 = 120
    # Add 10 to both sides of the equation:
    # 4v = 130
    # Divide both sides by 4 to find 'v':
    vanilla_scoops = (total_scoops + 10) / 4
    
    # Now, we can find the number of chocolate scoops and strawberry scoops:
    chocolate_scoops = 2 * vanilla_scoops
    strawberry_scoops = vanilla_scoops - 10
    
    return (vanilla_scoops, chocolate_scoops, strawberry_scoops)

# Let's calculate the scoops sold for each flavor:
scoops_sold = calculate_scoops_sold()
scoops_sold  # This will return a tuple with the number of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry scoops respectively.
```

This Python function calculates the number of scoops of each flavor sold by setting up equations based on the information given in the word problem, solving the equation for the number of vanilla scoops, and then calculates the chocolate and strawberry scoops accordingly.
Topic: volleyball ### Question:
A volleyball team won twice as many games as they lost. If they played a total of 18 games, how many games did they win and how many did they lose?

### Solution:
```python
def volleyball_games():
    # Total games played is 18
    total_games = 18
    
    # Let the number of losses be x
    # Then, the number of wins is twice the losses, so 2x
    # Together, the total number of games is the sum of wins and losses: x + 2x = 18
    # Solving the equation for x, we get 3x = 18, so x = 18 / 3 = 6 (losses)
    losses = total_games / 3
    
    # The number of wins is twice the number of losses
    wins = 2 * losses
    
    # Returning the number of wins and losses as a tuple
    return (wins, losses)

# Call the function and print the result
number_of_wins, number_of_losses = volleyball_games()
print(f"The team won {int(number_of_wins)} games and lost {int(number_of_losses)} games.")

# Example usage
# volleyball_games() would return (12, 6)
```
This Python function calculates the number of wins and losses for the volleyball team based on the given math word problem. The comments explain each step in solving the problem to find the answer.
Topic: Super Mario Question: Super Mario collected 120 coins in the Mushroom Kingdom, 150 coins in Bowser's Castle, and used 50 coins at Toad's shop to buy a power-up. If he gets a bonus of 30 coins each time he rescues Princess Peach and he rescued her three times, how many coins does he have in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Coins collected in the Mushroom Kingdom
    mushroom_kingdom_coins = 120
    
    # Coins collected in Bowser's Castle
    bowsers_castle_coins = 150
    
    # Coins used at Toad's shop for a power-up
    toads_shop_expense = 50
    
    # Bonus coins for rescuing Princess Peach
    peach_rescue_bonus = 30
    
    # Times he rescued Princess Peach
    rescues = 3
    
    # Total coins after collections and spending
    # Added bonus coins for rescuing Princess Peach multiple times
    total_coins = (mushroom_kingdom_coins + bowsers_castle_coins - toads_shop_expense) + (peach_rescue_bonus * rescues)
    
    return total_coins
```

In this Python function, we calculate the sum of the coins collected from the two levels and subtract the coins used to buy the power-up. Further, we add the bonus coins earned by rescuing Princess Peach, multiplying the bonus by the number of rescues. This gives us the total amount of coins that Mario has.
Topic: swimming Question: In a swimming competition, the pool length is 50 meters. If a swimmer completes 8 laps in the pool, how many meters has the swimmer covered?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Pool length is 50 meters
    pool_length = 50
    # A lap involves swimming to the other end of the pool and back,
    # so it's double the pool length
    lap_distance = pool_length * 2
    
    # The swimmer completes 8 laps
    laps_completed = 8
    
    # The swimmer's total distance covered is the lap distance times the number of laps
    total_distance_covered = lap_distance * laps_completed
    return total_distance_covered
```
Topic: LeBron James Question: LeBron James scores an average of 27 points per game. If he plays 3 games this week, how many points in total will he score?

    # LeBron James scores an average of 27 points per game
    average_points_per_game = 27
    # He plays 3 games this week
    number_of_games = 3
    # The total number of points he will score is
    total_points = average_points_per_game * number_of_games
    return total_points
```

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. First, identify the average points LeBron scores in a single game, which is 27.
2. Next, determine how many games he plays this week, which is 3.
3. Finally, multiply his average points by the number of games to find the total points.

Solution:

```python
def solution():
    # The first planet requires 120 units of cargo
    first_planet_cargo = 120
    # The second planet needs twice as much as the first
    second_planet_cargo = first_planet_cargo * 2
    # The third planet needs half as much as the second
    third_planet_cargo = second_planet_cargo / 2
    # Calculate total cargo for all planets
    total_cargo = first_planet_cargo + second_planet_cargo + third_planet_cargo
    # The answer is
    return total_cargo

# Uncomment the following line to test the function

Topic: Spiderman Question: Spiderman has been swinging through the city to stop crime. He started with 150 web cartridges. During a day of fighting crime, he used 48 cartridges against Doctor Octopus, 37 against Rhino, and then had to use some more against Vulture. When he returned home, he only had 22 cartridges left. How many cartridges did he use against Vulture?

Solution:
```python
def cartridges_used_against_vulture():
    # Spiderman started with 150 web cartridges
    initial_cartridges = 150
    # Used 48 cartridges against Doctor Octopus
    cartridges_doctor_octopus = 48
    # Used 37 cartridges against Rhino
    cartridges_rhino = 37
    # Spiderman had 22 cartridges left when he returned home
    cartridges_left = 22
    # The number of cartridges used against Vulture is the initial number minus what was used and what's left
    cartridges_vulture = initial_cartridges - cartridges_doctor_octopus - cartridges_rhino - cartridges_left
    # The answer is
    return cartridges_vulture

# Uncomment the line below to test the function:
# print(cartridges_used_against_vulture())
```

In this Python function, we perform a simple calculation to find out how many web cartridges Spiderman used against Vulture by subtracting the cartridges used and the ones left from the initial total amount of cartridges.

    won_matches = 15
    # The win to loss ratio is 3:1
    win_to_loss_ratio = 3
    # Calculate the number of matches the team lost
    # Since the win_to_loss_ratio is 3 and represents the won matches,
    # we can find the lost matches by dividing the won matches by this ratio
    lost_matches = won_matches / win_to_loss_ratio
    # The answer is
    return int(lost_matches)

# Uncomment the following line to execute the function and obtain the result

Batman is on a mission to save Gotham City and he needs to use his Batarangs. If he starts with 50 Batarangs in his utility belt and uses 17 to disarm traps and another 8 to detain henchmen, how many Batarangs does he have left to confront the Joker?

### Solution:
```python
def remaining_batarangs():
    # Batman starts with 50 Batarangs
    initial_batarangs = 50
    # He uses 17 to disarm traps
    batarangs_for_traps = 17
    # He uses 8 to detain henchmen
    batarangs_for_henchmen = 8
    # Calculate the remaining Batarangs after disarming traps and detaining henchmen
    remaining = initial_batarangs - (batarangs_for_traps + batarangs_for_henchmen)
    # Return the number of Batarangs left
    return remaining

# Call the function to get the result
batarangs_left = remaining_batarangs()
print(f'Batman has {batarangs_left} Batarangs left to confront the Joker.')
```

In this task, we defined the `remaining_batarangs` function that calculates the number of Batarangs Batman has after using some for various purposes. Comments were added to explain each step of the calculation. To find the solution, we subtract the Batarangs used for disarming traps and detaining henchmen from the initial total.

    jack_distance = jack_speed * time_swimming
    # Calculate the distance Jill swims
    jill_distance = jill_speed * time_swimming
    # Calculate the total distance they swam together
    total_distance = jack_distance + jill_distance
    return total_distance

# Uncomment the following line to test the function
# print(swimming_distance())
```

This Python function, `swimming_distance`, computes the total distance swam by both Jack and Jill by first calculating the distance each of them swam individually and then summing up those distances.
Topic: Hello Kitty Question: Hello Kitty was organizing her sticker collection. She found that she had 150 flower stickers, 120 heart stickers, and 95 star stickers. She decided to give 35 stickers of each kind to her friend. How many stickers of each kind does she have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Hello Kitty started with 150 flower stickers, 120 heart stickers, and 95 star stickers
    flower_stickers = 150
    heart_stickers = 120
    star_stickers = 95
    
    # She gave 35 stickers of each kind to her friend
    stickers_given_each = 35
    
    # Calculate stickers left after giving 35 of each kind
    flower_stickers_left = flower_stickers - stickers_given_each
    heart_stickers_left = heart_stickers - stickers_given_each
    star_stickers_left = star_stickers - stickers_given_each
    
    # The answer is the number of stickers left of each kind
    return {
        'flower_stickers_left': flower_stickers_left, 
        'heart_stickers_left': heart_stickers_left,
        'star_stickers_left': star_stickers_left
    }

# Now calling the function to check results
sticker_results = solution()
print(sticker_results)
```

This function calculates the number of stickers Hello Kitty has left for each type after giving some away to her friend. It then returns a dictionary with the result for each sticker type.
Topic: basketball Question: A basketball team scored a total of 98 points in a game. The team made a combination of 2-point field goals and 3-point field goals. If they made twice as many 2-point field goals as 3-point field goals, and they made 14 3-point field goals, how many 2-point field goals did they make?

Solution:
```python
def basketball_game_points():
    # The team made 14 3-point field goals
    three_point_goals = 14
    # Each 3-point field goal is worth 3 points
    three_point_score = three_point_goals * 3
    
    # The team made twice as many 2-point field goals as 3-point field goals
    two_point_goals = three_point_goals * 2
    # Each 2-point field goal is worth 2 points
    two_point_score = two_point_goals * 2
    
    # The total points scored is the sum of points from 2-point field goals and 3-point field goals
    total_score = two_point_score + three_point_score
    if total_score == 98:
        # The answer is the number of 2-point field goals made
        result = two_point_goals
    else:
        result = "It seems there is an error in the given data or calculations."
        
    return result

# Let's find out how many 2-point field goals the team made
print(basketball_game_points())
```
This function calculates the number of 2-point field goals based on the given information and checks if the total points align with the reported score. If the data is consistent, it returns the number of 2-point field goals made by the team. Otherwise, it indicates a potential error.
Topic: Hello Kitty Question: Hello Kitty has 5 apples. She gives 2 apples to her friend Mimmy. Later, her friend Daniel gives her 4 more apples as a gift. How many apples does Hello Kitty have now?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Hello Kitty starts with 5 apples
    initial_apples = 5
    # She gives 2 apples to Mimmy
    apples_given = 2
    # Daniel gives her 4 more apples
    apples_received = 4
    # The answer is
    result = initial_apples - apples_given + apples_received
    return result
```

This Python function starts by setting the number of apples Hello Kitty has initially, then subtracts the number given away, and finally adds the number received from Daniel. The function then returns the total number of apples Hello Kitty has in the end.
Topic: Minecraft Question: In Minecraft, Alex has gathered 64 iron ore blocks, 32 gold ore blocks, and 16 diamond ore blocks. She then uses a furnace to smelt each iron and gold ore block into one iron ingot and one gold ingot respectively, while diamond ore blocks drop one diamond each when mined. If Alex wants to craft a full set of armor, which requires 24 iron ingots for iron armor, 24 gold ingots for gold armor, and 24 diamonds for diamond armor, does she have enough materials to craft any of the armor sets?

Solution:
```python
def solution(iron_ore, gold_ore, diamond_ore):
    # Required number of materials for a full set of armor
    required_materials = 24
    
    # Each ore block gives one ingot or diamond
    iron_ingots = iron_ore
    gold_ingots = gold_ore
    diamonds = diamond_ore

    # Determine if Alex has enough iron, gold, and diamonds
    iron_armor_possible = iron_ingots >= required_materials
    gold_armor_possible = gold_ingots >= required_materials
    diamond_armor_possible = diamonds >= required_materials

    # Return a tuple that tells us if each set of armor can be crafted
    return (iron_armor_possible, gold_armor_possible, diamond_armor_possible)

# Alex's gathered materials
iron_ore_blocks = 64
gold_ore_blocks = 32
diamond_ore_blocks = 16

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution(iron_ore_blocks, gold_ore_blocks, diamond_ore_blocks))
```

To solve the word problem, you would call the `solution` function with the number of iron, gold, and diamond ore blocks that Alex has gathered. The function calculates the number of ingots and diamonds that can be obtained, then determines if the quantities are sufficient to craft a full set of armor for each type. 

The printed result is a tuple with three boolean values indicating whether Alex can craft iron armor, gold armor, and diamond armor, respectively, with `True` meaning that crafting is possible and `False` meaning it is not possible.
Topic: pizza Question: A pizza party was organized for three friends to celebrate the end of the school year. They decided to order some pizzas for their party. If each pizza had 8 slices and they ordered enough pizzas for each friend to have 10 slices, how many whole pizzas did they need to order?

Solution:
```python
def pizza_order():
    # Each friend wants to have 10 slices
    slices_per_friend = 10
    # There are three friends
    number_of_friends = 3
    # Each pizza has 8 slices
    slices_per_pizza = 8

    # Total slices needed is the number of friends multiplied by slices each wants
    total_slices_needed = number_of_friends * slices_per_friend
    # Total pizzas needed is the total number of slices needed divided by the number of slices per pizza
    # We use the ceiling division because we can't order a fraction of a pizza
    total_pizzas_needed = -(-total_slices_needed // slices_per_pizza)  # Ceiling division to get the whole number of pizzas

    return total_pizzas_needed

# Uncomment below to run the function
# print(pizza_order())
```

This Python function uses the ceiling division trick `(-(-a // b))` to return the smallest integer greater than or equal to `a / b`, which ensures that if there's any remainder after division, it rounds up to the next whole pizza.
Topic: Spiderman ### Question:
Spiderman has 50 meters of web fluid in his cartridges. He uses 15 meters of web to swing between buildings. If he rescues a cat stuck in a tree using 2 meters and helps with a traffic accident using another 8 meters, how much web fluid will Spiderman have left?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Spiderman starts with 50 meters of web fluid
    initial_web_fluid = 50
    
    # He uses 15 meters to swing between buildings
    swing_web_used = 15
    
    # He uses 2 meters to rescue a cat
    cat_rescue_web_used = 2
    
    # He uses 8 meters to help with a traffic accident
    accident_web_used = 8
    
    # The amount of web fluid left is the initial amount minus what was used
    web_fluid_left = initial_web_fluid - swing_web_used - cat_rescue_web_used - accident_web_used
    
    return web_fluid_left

# Call the function to obtain the result.
result = solution()
print(f"Spiderman will have {result} meters of web fluid left.")
```
When you run the above Python function, it will compute the amount of web fluid Spiderman will have left after using it in the specified ways.
Topic: cats Question: Jenny has 12 cats. She decides to buy more cat beds so that each cat can sleep comfortably, but knows that cats like to sleep together. If each bed can fit 3 cats, how many cat beds does Jenny need to buy for all her cats?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Jenny has 12 cats
    total_cats = 12
    # Each bed can fit 3 cats
    cats_per_bed = 3
    # Calculate the number of beds needed by dividing the total number of cats by the number of cats per bed and taking the ceiling value to ensure each cat has a bed to sleep in.
    number_of_beds = -(-total_cats // cats_per_bed)  # Ceiling division to ensure we have enough beds even if it's not a perfect multiple
    return number_of_beds
```
The function calculates the number of beds Jenny needs by performing an integer division with a ceiling value to make sure each cat has a bed to sleep in, even if there are extra spots available.
Topic: candy ### Question: 
In a candy store, there is a jar of jellybeans. If the store owner arranges the jellybeans in groups of 5, there will be 3 jellybeans left over. If the jellybeans are arranged in groups of 7, there will be 2 jellybeans left over. However, when the jellybeans are arranged in groups of 8, there are no jellybeans left over. If the jar contains fewer than 150 jellybeans, how many jellybeans are in the jar?

### Solution:
```python
def find_jellybeans():
    # The jar contains fewer than 150 jellybeans]
    max_jellybeans = 150
    
    # Check each number from 1 to max_jellybeans to find the right number of jellybeans
    for num in range(1, max_jellybeans):
        # If the number of jellybeans leaves 3 when divided by 5
        if num % 5 == 3:
            # If the same number leaves 2 when divided by 7
            if num % 7 == 2:
                # If the same number is exactly divisible by 8
                if num % 8 == 0:
                    # This number fits all conditions, so it's the answer
                    return num
    
    return None

# Uncomment the following line to test the function:
# print(find_jellybeans())
```

To solve this word problem, you could call `find_jellybeans()` which contains a for loop to incrementally check every number up to 150. For each number, it checks whether it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, a remainder of 2 when divided by 7, and no remainder when divided by 8. Once it finds a number that satisfies all these conditions, it returns that number as the solution. The number returned will be the total number of jellybeans in the jar.
Topic: Minecraft Question: Steve is playing Minecraft and goes mining for diamonds. He finds a vein of 8 diamonds. He later finds two more veins, one with 5 diamonds and another with 7 diamonds. If Steve uses 6 diamonds to make a pickaxe and a sword, how many diamonds does he have left?

Solution:
```python
def calculate_remaining_diamonds():
    # Steve finds the first vein of diamonds
    first_vein = 8
    # Finds a second vein
    second_vein = 5
    # And a third vein
    third_vein = 7
    
    # Total diamonds found
    total_diamonds_found = first_vein + second_vein + third_vein
    
    # Diamonds used to make tools
    diamonds_used_for_tools = 6
    
    # Remaining diamonds after making tools
    remaining_diamonds = total_diamonds_found - diamonds_used_for_tools
    
    return remaining_diamonds

# Using the function to find the solution
remaining_diamonds = calculate_remaining_diamonds()
print(f"Steve has {remaining_diamonds} diamonds left.")
```

If you run this Python function, it will calculate and print the number of diamonds that Steve has left after making a pickaxe and a sword.
Topic: ice cream ### Question:
An ice cream shop sold 125 scoops of vanilla ice cream, 97 scoops of chocolate ice cream, and twice as many scoops of strawberry ice cream as chocolate ice cream. How many scoops of ice cream did the shop sell in total?

### Solution:
```python
def total_scoops():
    # Number of vanilla scoops sold
    vanilla_scoops = 125
    # Number of chocolate scoops sold
    chocolate_scoops = 97
    # Number of strawberry scoops sold, which is twice the number of chocolate scoops
    strawberry_scoops = chocolate_scoops * 2
    # Total scoops sold is the sum of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry scoops
    total = vanilla_scoops + chocolate_scoops + strawberry_scoops
    return total

# Call the function and print the result
print("Total scoops of ice cream sold:", total_scoops())
```

When you run this code, it will calculate and print the total number of ice cream scoops sold by the shop.
Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder ### Question:
Thor, the God of Thunder, has to defend Asgard from an army of 500 Frost Giants. If he can strike down 25 Frost Giants with a single bolt of lightning and he summons 10 bolts of lightning, how many Frost Giants are left after his thunderous attack?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of Frost Giants
    total_frost_giants = 500
    # Frost Giants struck down per bolt of lightning
    frost_giants_per_bolt = 25
    # Number of bolts of lightning summoned
    bolts_of_lightning = 10
    
    # Calculate the number of Frost Giants struck down
    frost_giants_struck = frost_giants_per_bolt * bolts_of_lightning
    # Calculate the number of Frost Giants left after the attack
    frost_giants_left = total_frost_giants - frost_giants_struck
    
    # The answer is
    result = frost_giants_left
    return result

# Call the function to get the result
print(solution())
```
When this function is called, it will calculate that Thor has struck down 250 Frost Giants (25 giants per bolt times 10 bolts), leaving 250 Frost Giants remaining (500 initial giants minus 250 struck down).
Topic: Naruto Question: Naruto has a collection of ninja scrolls. He has 15 scrolls from the Hidden Leaf Village and twice as many from the Hidden Sand Village. If he gave 10 scrolls from the Hidden Sand Village to his friend Sasuke, how many scrolls does he have now from both villages?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Naruto has 15 scrolls from the Hidden Leaf Village
    leaf_village_scrolls = 15
    # He has twice as many scrolls from the Hidden Sand Village
    sand_village_scrolls = 2 * leaf_village_scrolls
    # He gave 10 scrolls from the Hidden Sand Village to Sasuke
    scrolls_given = 10
    # Scrolls left from the Hidden Sand Village
    sand_village_scrolls -= scrolls_given
    # Total scrolls he has now from both villages
    total_scrolls = leaf_village_scrolls + sand_village_scrolls
    return total_scrolls

# Now let's call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This Python function follows the logic of the problem by first calculating how many scrolls Naruto has from each village, subtracting the ones he gave away, and adding up what remains to find the total count of scrolls from both villages. The `print(solution())` call executes the function and prints out the answer to the terminal.
Topic: Steph Curry Question: In a basketball game, Steph Curry made 9 successful three-point shots and 7 successful two-point shots. If a three-point shot is worth 3 points and a two-point shot is worth 2 points, how many total points did Steph Curry score?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Steph Curry made 9 successful three-point shots
    three_point_shots = 9
    # He made 7 successful two-point shots
    two_point_shots = 7
    
    # A three-point shot is worth 3 points
    three_point_value = 3
    # A two-point shot is worth 2 points
    two_point_value = 2
    
    # Calculate the total points from three-point shots
    total_three_point_score = three_point_shots * three_point_value
    # Calculate the total points from two-point shots
    total_two_point_score = two_point_shots * two_point_value
    
    # The total points scored is the sum of the points from three- and two-point shots
    total_points = total_three_point_score + total_two_point_score
    
    # The answer is
    return total_points
```

Running the `solution()` function will yield the total points scored by Steph Curry in this scenario.

```

When the `solution()` function is called, it will calculate and return the total number of songs that will be on Taylor Swift's special playlist, which includes 5 songs from each of her 10 albums.
Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder ### Question:
Thor, the God of Thunder, must defeat a horde of 100 frost giants to protect Asgard. If Thor defeats 8 frost giants every time he swings his hammer Mjolnir, how many swings does it take for Thor to defeat all the frost giants?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of frost giants to defeat
    total_frost_giants = 100
    # Number of frost giants Thor defeats per swing of Mjolnir
    frost_giants_per_swing = 8
    # Calculate the number of swings needed by dividing total giants by giants defeated per swing
    # Since we can't have a fraction of a swing, we use the ceiling function to round up to the nearest whole number
    import math
    number_of_swings = math.ceil(total_frost_giants / frost_giants_per_swing)
    # The answer is
    return number_of_swings

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```

This code defines a function `solution` that first sets the number of frost giants Thor must defeat. It then determines how many frost giants he can defeat with each swing of his hammer. The `math.ceil()` function is used to ensure that the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, as Thor can't swing his hammer a fraction of the time.

By calling this function, it will return the number of swings Thor needs to make to defeat all 100 frost giants.
Topic: Power Rangers Question: The Power Rangers need to combine their power coins to defeat the monster. Each Ranger has a power coin with a different power level. The Red Ranger's coin has a power level of 5, the Blue Ranger's coin has a power level of 4, the Pink Ranger's coin has a power level of 3, the Black Ranger's coin has a power level of 2, and the Yellow Ranger's coin has a power level of 1. What is the total power level of all the Power Rangers' coins combined?

Solution:
```python
def power_rangers_total_power():
    # Red Ranger's coin power
    red_power = 5
    # Blue Ranger's coin power
    blue_power = 4
    # Pink Ranger's coin power
    pink_power = 3
    # Black Ranger's coin power
    black_power = 2
    # Yellow Ranger's coin power
    yellow_power = 1
    # Total power is the sum of all coin powers
    total_power = red_power + blue_power + pink_power + black_power + yellow_power
    # Return the total power level
    return total_power

# Call the function and print the result
print(power_rangers_total_power())
```
The function `power_rangers_total_power` calculates the total power level by adding each Ranger's power level. It then returns the sum, which represents the combined power level of the Power Rangers' coins.
Topic: Steph Curry Question: Steph Curry is playing in a basketball game, and he scores 3 pointers and 2 pointers. If he makes 4 shots from beyond the 3-point line and 7 shots from inside the 3-point line, how many total points does Steph Curry score?

Solution:
```python

    # Number of 3-point shots made
    shots_3_point = 4
    # Number of 2-point shots made
    shots_2_point = 7
    # Value of a 3-point shot
    value_3_point = 3
    # Value of a 2-point shot
    value_2_point = 2
    # Calculate the total points
    # Points from 3-point shots
    points_from_3_point = shots_3_point * value_3_point
    # Points from 2-point shots
    points_from_2_point = shots_2_point * value_2_point
    # Total points scored
    total_points = points_from_3_point + points_from_2_point
    # Return the result
    return total_points

# Call the function and print the result
points_scored = calculate_points()
print(f"Steph Curry scored a total of {points_scored} points.")
```

This Python function `calculate_points` calculates the total number of points scored by Steph Curry based on the number of 3-pointers and 2-pointers he made. The result is printed at the end, which shows the total points Steph Curry scored during the game.
Topic: trains Question: Train A leaves the station heading east at 60 miles per hour. Two hours later, Train B leaves the same station heading east on a parallel track at 80 miles per hour. How many hours after Train B leaves will it catch up to Train A?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Train A speed is 60 mph
    speed_A = 60
    # Train B speed is 80 mph
    speed_B = 80
    # Train B leaves 2 hours after Train A
    lead_time = 2
    # In those 2 hours, Train A would have covered
    distance_A_start = speed_A * lead_time
    
    # Train B needs to cover the distance Train A has already travelled plus the distance both trains will cover simultaneously. 
    # Let t be the time required for Train B to catch up after it started. We have the equation:
    # speed_A * t = distance_A_start + (speed_B * t)
    # Rearranging the equation to solve for time (t) after Train B leaves:
    # (speed_B - speed_A) * t = distance_A_start
    # Therefore, time (t) is:
    t = distance_A_start / (speed_B - speed_A)
    return t
    
# Call the solution function to find out the answer
hours_to_catch_up = solution()
print(f"Train B will catch up to Train A after {hours_to_catch_up} hours.")
```

In this problem, Train B must first cover the distance Train A has travelled during the 2 hours head start before they can be at the same point. Once Train B starts moving, it is catching up at the rate of (speed_B - speed_A) miles per hour. Dividing the distance Train A has covered by this rate gives the time it takes for Train B to catch up.
Topic: Harry Potter Question: Harry Potter has collected 150 Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. He gives Ron 30 beans and Hermione 20 beans. Later, Hagrid gives him 45 more beans as a gift. How many Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans does Harry Potter have now?

```python
def solution():
    # Harry Potter starts with 150 beans
    beans_initial = 150
    # He gives Ron 30 beans
    beans_to_ron = 30
    # He gives Hermione 20 beans
    beans_to_hermione = 20
    # Hagrid gives Harry 45 more beans
    beans_from_hagrid = 45
    # Calculate the result
    result = beans_initial - beans_to_ron - beans_to_hermione + beans_from_hagrid
    # Return the final count of beans
    return result

# Uncomment the line below to test the function
# print(solution())
```

This commented Python function `solution` computes the final number of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans that Harry Potter has after giving away some and receiving others.

Topic: lacrosse Question: A lacrosse team is preparing bags of equipment for its players. Each bag must contain 1 helmet, 1 stick, and 1 pair of gloves. The team has 18 helmets, 21 sticks, and 15 pairs of gloves. What is the maximum number of complete bags the team can prepare, and how many items of each type will be left over?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The team has 18 helmets
    helmets = 18
    # The team has 21 sticks
    sticks = 21
    # The team has 15 pairs of gloves
    gloves = 15
    
    # To find the maximum number of complete bags the team can prepare,
    # we find the smallest number among the equipment which will limit the number of complete bags
    max_complete_bags = min(helmets, sticks, gloves)
    
    # To find the leftovers, we subtract the number of each item used in the bags from the total count
    helmets_leftover = helmets - max_complete_bags
    sticks_leftover = sticks - max_complete_bags
    gloves_leftover = gloves - max_complete_bags
    
    # Return a tuple with the maximum number of complete bags and leftovers
    return max_complete_bags, helmets_leftover, sticks_leftover, gloves_leftover

# Example of how to use the function:
bags, helmets_left, sticks_left, gloves_left = solution()
print(f"Maximum complete bags: {bags}")
print(f"Leftover helmets: {helmets_left}")
print(f"Leftover sticks: {sticks_left}")
print(f"Leftover gloves: {gloves_left}")

```python
def solution():
    # Steph Curry scored a total of 35 points
    total_points = 35
    # Points per 3-pointer
    points_per_3pointer = 3
    # Number of 3-point shots made
    num_3pointers = 7
    # Total points from 3-pointers
    total_points_3pointers = num_3pointers * points_per_3pointer
    # Points from 2-point shots are remaining points
    remaining_points = total_points - total_points_3pointers
    # Points per 2-pointer
    points_per_2pointer = 2
    # Number of 2-point shots is equal to remaining points divided by 2
    num_2pointers = remaining_points // points_per_2pointer
    return num_2pointers
```
This function calculates the number of 2-point shots made by Steph Curry after subtracting the points earned from 3-pointers out of the total. To find the number of 2-point shots, the remaining points are divided by the value of each 2-pointer (which is 2 points). The `//` operator is used for integer division to get the whole number of 2-point shots.

Topic: Fortnite ### Question:
In a game of Fortnite, Maya starts with 100 health points. During a battle, she loses 25 health points when she's caught outside the storm. She finds a medkit that heals her for 50 health points. Then, she takes 30 damage from an enemy player. How many health points does Maya have now?

### Solution:
```python
def maya_health():
    # Maya starts with 100 health points
    initial_health = 100
    # She loses 25 health points in the storm
    storm_damage = 25
    # She finds a medkit which heals her for 50 health points
    medkit_heal = 50
    # She takes 30 damage from an enemy
    enemy_damage = 30

    # Calculate Maya's health after storm damage and healing
    post_storm_health = initial_health - storm_damage + medkit_heal
    # Calculate Maya's final health after enemy damage
    final_health = post_storm_health - enemy_damage

    # Maya's health points now are
    return final_health

# Call the function to get the result
maya_current_health = maya_health()
```

When you run this function, it will calculate the health points Maya has after all the events that occurred.
Topic: trains Question: Two trains are on the same track and are traveling toward each other. Train A is moving at 70 miles per hour and Train B is moving at 80 miles per hour. If the trains are currently 450 miles apart, how long will it take before they meet?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Train A is moving at 70 miles per hour
    speed_of_train_A = 70
    # Train B is moving at 80 miles per hour
    speed_of_train_B = 80
    # The trains are 450 miles apart
    distance_apart = 450

    # They are moving towards each other so we add their speeds
    combined_speed = speed_of_train_A + speed_of_train_B
    
    # The time it takes for the trains to meet is distance divided by speed
    time_until_meet = distance_apart / combined_speed
    
    # The answer is the time until they meet
    return time_until_meet

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```
This Python function calculates the time it will take for two trains moving towards each other to meet, given their speeds and the initial distance between them.
Topic: swimming Question: There is a swimming competition consisting of 3 different races. In the first race, Michael swims 100 meters. In the second race, he swims twice as long as the first race. Lastly, in the third race, he swims 150 meters less than he did in the second race. How many meters did Michael swim in total?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Michael swims 100 meters in the first race
    first_race = 100
    # In the second race, he swims twice as long as the first race
    second_race = first_race * 2
    # In the third race, he swims 150 meters less than the second race
    third_race = second_race - 150
    # The total distance swum is the sum of all three races
    total_distance = first_race + second_race + third_race
    return total_distance
```

By calling the `solution()` function, we would get the total number of meters Michael swam in all the races combined.
Topic: Batman Question: Batman has 150 Batarangs in his utility belt. He uses 23 Batarangs to disarm traps set by the Riddler and 15 more Batarangs in a battle against the Penguin's henchmen. How many Batarangs does Batman have left in his utility belt?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Batman starts with 150 Batarangs
    batarangs_initial = 150
    # He uses 23 Batarangs to disarm traps set by the Riddler
    batarangs_for_riddler_traps = 23
    # He uses 15 more Batarangs in a battle against the Penguin's henchmen
    batarangs_for_penguins_henchmen = 15
    # The answer is the initial count minus the number used in both situations
    remaining_batarangs = batarangs_initial - batarangs_for_riddler_traps - batarangs_for_penguins_henchmen
    # Return the number of Batarangs left
    return remaining_batarangs

# Calling the function to get the result
print(solution())
```
The function `solution` calculates the number of Batarangs Batman has left after deducting the ones he used to disarm traps and in the battle.
Topic: cars Question: There are 3 car dealerships in town. The first dealership has 35 cars, the second dealership has twice as many cars as the first, and the third dealership has 15 fewer cars than the second dealership. How many cars are there in total at all three dealerships?

```python
def solution():
    # First dealership has 35 cars
    first_dealership = 35
    
    # Second dealership has twice as many cars as the first
    second_dealership = 2 * first_dealership
    
    # Third dealership has 15 fewer cars than the second dealership
    third_dealership = second_dealership - 15
    
    # Add up all the cars from the three dealerships to get the total
    total_cars = first_dealership + second_dealership + third_dealership
    
    return total_cars

# Example usage
print(solution())  # This will print the total number of cars across the three dealerships
```

When this Python function is called, it will calculate the number of cars at each dealership based on the information provided and then sum them up to find the total number of cars at all three dealerships.
Topic: Naruto ### Question:
Naruto is training to increase his chakra levels. He managed to gather 300 chakra points on the first day, doubled his chakra points on the second day, and added another 150 chakra points on the third day. How many chakra points does Naruto have in total by the end of the third day?

### Solution:
```python
def calculate_chakra_points():
    # Naruto gathered 300 chakra points on the first day
    day_one_chakra = 300
    # On the second day, he doubled his chakra points
    day_two_chakra = day_one_chakra * 2
    # On the third day, he added another 150 chakra points
    day_three_additional_chakra = 150
    # Total chakra points at the end of the third day
    total_chakra = day_two_chakra + day_three_additional_chakra
    return total_chakra

# Call the function and print the result to show the total chakra points
print(calculate_chakra_points())
```
This function calculates the total chakra points Naruto has by the end of the third day. On the first day, he starts with 300 points. On the second day, he doubles this amount, so we multiply it by 2. Finally, on the third day, he adds 150 more points to the doubled amount. The sum of these points gives us the total chakra points Naruto has accumulated.
Topic: cats ### Question:
Olivia has a box of cat treats. If she gives 5 treats to each of her 4 cats every day, the treats will last for 16 days. How many treats are in the box?

    # Olivia gives 5 treats to each of her 4 cats
    treats_per_cat = 5
    number_of_cats = 4
    # The treats will last for 16 days
    days = 16

    # First calculate the total treats given each day
    total_treats_per_day = treats_per_cat * number_of_cats

    # Then multiply by the number of days to find the total treats in the box
    total_treats_in_box = total_treats_per_day * days
    return total_treats_in_box

# Call the function and print the result
print(solution())
```
This function will calculate the total number of cat treats in Olivia's box based on the given information.

Topic: cheer leading Question: A cheerleading squad is performing a routine that requires groups of cheerleaders to form pyramids. Each pyramid has 3 cheerleaders at the base and 1 cheerleader at the top. If the squad has 16 cheerleaders in total, how many pyramids can they form?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Each pyramid requires 3 cheerleaders at the base and 1 at the top, for a total of 4 cheerleaders per pyramid
    cheerleaders_per_pyramid = 4
    # There are 16 cheerleaders in the squad
    total_cheerleaders = 16
    # The number of pyramids they can form is the total number divided by the number needed for one pyramid
    pyramids_formed = total_cheerleaders // cheerleaders_per_pyramid
    # The answer is
    return pyramids_formed

# Uncomment the line below and run to find out how many pyramids can be formed
# print(solution())
```

This Python function will compute the number of full pyramids that the cheerleading squad can form, using the `//` operator for integer division because only whole pyramids can be formed. The result will not include any partially formed pyramids.
Topic: Taylor Swift Question: Taylor Swift is planning a mini-concert series and will perform 3 concerts a day. Each concert lasts 2 hours. She needs to make sure she takes a total of 1 hour of breaks throughout the day to rest her voice. How many hours in total does she perform if she does this for 5 days?

Solution:
```python
def concert_hours(days):
    # Taylor performs 3 concerts a day.
    concerts_per_day = 3
    # Each concert lasts 2 hours.
    concert_duration = 2
    # She takes a total of 1 hour of breaks throughout the day.
    breaks_per_day = 1
    # Calculate total concert hours per day without the breaks.
    total_hours_per_day = concerts_per_day * concert_duration
    # Calculate the total performance hours over the given number of days, subtracting the breaks.
    total_performance_hours = (total_hours_per_day - breaks_per_day) * days
    # The answer is
    return total_performance_hours

# Using the function for 5 days
print(concert_hours(5))
```
In this solution, we first determine the amount of time Taylor performs each day by multiplying the number of concerts by the duration. We then subtract the break time and finally multiply by the number of days to find the total hours Taylor performs without breaks over five days.
Topic: cats Question: Mrs. Smith has 4 cats. Each cat has 5 kittens. Each kitten has 4 toys. How many toys are there in total?

Solution:

    # Mrs. Smith has 4 cats
    number_of_cats = 4
    # Each cat has 5 kittens
    kittens_per_cat = 5
    # Each kitten has 4 toys
    toys_per_kitten = 4
    # Calculate the total number of kittens
    total_kittens = number_of_cats * kittens_per_cat
    # Calculate the total number of toys
    total_toys = total_kittens * toys_per_kitten
    # The answer is the total number of toys
    return total_toys

# Call the function and print the result to check
print(solution())
```
This function calculates the total number of toys by first determining the total number of kittens (by multiplying the number of cats by the number of kittens each cat has), and then multiplying the total number of kittens by the number of toys each kitten has. The function then returns the total number of toys.
Topic: Steph Curry Question: Steph Curry, a basketball player, scored 36 points in one game. He made an equal number of 2-point shots and 3-point shots to score these points. How many shots of each type did he make?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Steph Curry scored a total of 36 points.
    total_points = 36
    # Let's assume he made 'x' shots of each type.
    # Since each 2-point shot gives him 2 points and each 3-point shot gives him 3 points,
    # the equation representing the situation will be 2x + 3x = 36.
    # Solving for 'x' would give us the number of shots of each type he made.
    # Simplifying the equation gives us 5x = 36.
    # Dividing both sides by 5 gives us x = 36 / 5.
    shots_each_type = total_points / 5
    # However, since he can't make a fraction of a shot and the question assumes an equal number,
    # we should look for a whole number solution.
    # We know that he made an equal number of 2-point and 3-point shots, and since the 2 and 3-point shots give
    # a common multiple of 10 points (2 shots * 2 points + 1 shot * 3 points),
    # we find how many times 10 goes into 36 to give us how many cycles of shots he made.
    cycles_of_shots = total_points // 10

    # Therefore, knowing the cycles of shots he made, we calculate the total number of each type.
    two_point_shots = cycles_of_shots * 2
    three_point_shots = cycles_of_shots
    
    # We now need to calculate the remaining points after accounting for complete cycles of shots
    remaining_points = total_points - (cycles_of_shots * 10)
    
    # Depending on the remaining points, he either made two 3-point shots or three 2-point shots or one of each.
    # Since we are assuming an equal number, if we have 6 remaining points, they must have come from two 3-point shots.
    # If we have less than 6 remaining points, they must have come from 2-point shots.
    
    if remaining_points >= 6:
        two_point_shots += 1
        three_point_shots += 2
    else:
        two_point_shots += remaining_points // 2
    
    # The final answer is the number of each type of shots he made.
    return two_point_shots, three_point_shots

# Call the function and print the result
two_point_shots, three_point_shots = solution()
print(f"Steph Curry made {two_point_shots} 2-point shots and {three_point_shots} 3-point shots.")
```

Note that the problem implicitly assumes that Steph Curry did not shoot any free throws (1-point shots) to score his points. This is typical in simplifying word problems for grade school math, despite not necessarily reflecting the complexity of scoring in an actual basketball game.

```python
def solution():
    # Number of crystals found on planet Xandar
    crystals_xandar = 12
    # Number of crystals found on planet Hala
    crystals_hala = 7
    # Number of crystals found on planet Torfa, which is twice as many as on Hala
    crystals_torfa = 2 * crystals_hala
    # Total number of crystals is the sum from all planets
    total_crystals = crystals_xandar + crystals_hala + crystals_torfa
    return total_crystals

# Uncomment the following line to see the result:

Solution:
```python
def count_dog_treats():
    # Jenny has 3 bags of dog treats
    total_bags = 3
    # Each bag contains 25 treats
    treats_per_bag = 25
    # Total treats at the start
    total_treats = total_bags * treats_per_bag
    # She uses 2 bags completely so treats used
    treats_used = 2 * treats_per_bag
    # She gives away 10 treats from the third bag
    treats_given_away = 10
    # The answer is the initial total minus treats used and given away
    treats_left = total_treats - treats_used - treats_given_away
    return treats_left

# Call the function and print the result
print(count_dog_treats())
```

When you run the function `count_dog_treats`, it will return the number of dog treats Jenny has left.

    # Team A scores twice as many in the second half
    goals_teamA_second_half = goals_teamA_first_half * 2
    # Team B scores 7 goals in the first half
    goals_teamB_first_half = 7
    # Team B scores 5 more in the second half
    goals_teamB_second_half = goals_teamB_first_half + 5
    
    # Total goals for team A
    total_goals_teamA = goals_teamA_first_half + goals_teamA_second_half
    # Total goals for team B
    total_goals_teamB = goals_teamB_first_half + goals_teamB_second_half
    
    # The answer is
    result = total_goals_teamA - total_goals_teamB
    return result

# Example call to the function

```

Running the function would yield the result, which is the remaining health points of the monster after the Power Rangers' attack.
Topic: dinosaurs ### Question:
In Dr. Park's Jurassic era simulation, she observed that the number of Stegosauruses was triple the number of Velociraptors. The simulation contained 8 Velociraptors. If the simulation also included 5 Triceratops and twice as many Pterodactyls as Triceratops, how many dinosaurs were there in total?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of Velociraptors
    velociraptors = 8
    # Stegosauruses are triple the number of Velociraptors
    stegosauruses = 3 * velociraptors
    # There are 5 Triceratops
    triceratops = 5
    # There are twice as many Pterodactyls as Triceratops
    pterodactyls = 2 * triceratops
    # Total number of dinosaurs
    total_dinosaurs = velociraptors + stegosauruses + triceratops + pterodactyls
    # The answer is
    return total_dinosaurs

# Call the function and print the result to confirm
print(solution())
```

This Python function calculates the total number of dinosaurs in Dr. Park's Jurassic era simulation by first defining the known numbers of each species, calculating the others based on given relationships, and then summing them up.
Topic: Fortnite Question: In Fortnite, Alex finds 3 loot chests. The first chest contains 50 shield points, the second chest contains 100 shield points, and the third chest contains 20 shield points. However, before he can use the shield points, he is hit by a storm that causes him to lose 60 shield points. How many shield points does Alex have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    #First chest shield points
    chest_one = 50
    #Second chest shield points
    chest_two = 100
    #Third chest shield points
    chest_three = 20
    #Total shield points found
    total_shield = chest_one + chest_two + chest_three
    #Shield points lost in the storm
    shield_lost = 60
    #Shield points left after the storm
    shield_left = total_shield - shield_lost
    return shield_left
```

This Python function calculates how many shield points Alex has after finding three chests and losing some points to the storm.
Topic: Super Mario Question: Super Mario collected 120 coins while playing through the Mushroom Kingdom. He spent 50 coins to buy a power-up and another 30 coins on a 1-up mushroom. How many coins does Super Mario have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Super Mario initially collected 120 coins
    total_coins = 120
    # He spent 50 coins on a power-up
    power_up_cost = 50
    # He spent another 30 coins on a 1-up mushroom
    one_up_mushroom_cost = 30
    # To find out how many coins he has left, we subtract the coins spent from the total
    coins_left = total_coins - power_up_cost - one_up_mushroom_cost
    # The answer is the amount of coins left
    return coins_left
```
Calling the above function `solution()` would return the number of coins Super Mario has after his purchases.
Topic: trains Question: Two trains are traveling towards each other on parallel tracks. Train A is traveling at 40 miles per hour, and Train B is traveling at 60 miles per hour. They start off 200 miles apart. After how many hours will they meet?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Train A speed
    train_a_speed = 40  # in miles per hour
    # Train B speed
    train_b_speed = 60  # in miles per hour
    # Initial distance between the trains
    initial_distance = 200  # in miles
    
    # The relative speed at which the trains are closing in on each other
    closing_speed = train_a_speed + train_b_speed  # in miles per hour
    
    # The time it takes for the trains to meet is the initial distance
    # divided by the closing speed
    time_to_meet = initial_distance / closing_speed  # in hours
    
    # The answer is
    return time_to_meet

# Calling the function to test
print(solution())
```

In this function, `solution()`, we calculate the relative speed at which the two trains are closing the distance between them, which is the aggregate of their individual speeds. We then divide the initial distance by the closing speed to find the number of hours it will take for them to meet. The function returns this value.
Topic: Power Rangers ### Response:
Question: The Power Rangers are battling a monster that has 500 health points (HP). Red Ranger attacks and reduces the monster's HP by 150. Yellow Ranger then attacks and reduces its HP by a further 100 points. How much HP does the monster have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # The monster has an initial HP of 500
    monster_hp_initial = 500
    
    # Red Ranger's attack reduces the HP by 150
    red_ranger_damage = 150
    
    # Yellow Ranger's attack reduces the HP by 100
    yellow_ranger_damage = 100
    
    # Calculate the remaining HP after both attacks
    monster_hp_remaining = monster_hp_initial - red_ranger_damage - yellow_ranger_damage
    
    # The answer is
    return monster_hp_remaining
```
This Python function calculates the remaining health points of the monster after attacks from the Red and Yellow Rangers.
Topic: lacrosse Question: A lacrosse team plays 3 matches in a tournament. In the first match, they score 12 goals. In the second match, they score twice as many goals as in the first match. In the third match, they score half as many goals as in the second match. How many goals does the team score in total?

Solution:
```python
def total_goals():
    # In the first match, the team scores 12 goals
    first_match_goals = 12
    # In the second match, they score twice as many goals as in the first match
    second_match_goals = 2 * first_match_goals
    # In the third match, they score half as many goals as in the second match
    third_match_goals = second_match_goals / 2
    # The total number of goals scored is the sum of the goals from all three matches
    total = first_match_goals + second_match_goals + third_match_goals
    return total

# Uncomment the line below to test the function
# print(total_goals())
```

If you run the function, it will calculate the total number of goals scored by the lacrosse team over the three matches.
Topic: Pokémon Question: Ash caught 15 Pokémon in the morning and then traded some of them to Misty. If he has 8 Pokémon left, how many Pokémon did he trade to Misty?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Ash caught 15 Pokémon in the morning
    pokemon_caught = 15
    # He has 8 Pokémon left after trading some to Misty
    pokemon_left = 8
    # The answer is the number of Pokémon he traded away
    pokemon_traded = pokemon_caught - pokemon_left
    # Returning the number of Pokémon traded
    return pokemon_traded
```

Note: In the `solution()` function, we calculate the number of Pokémon traded by subtracting the number of Pokémon left from the number Ash originally caught. Hence, the function returns the number of Pokémon that Ash traded to Misty.
Topic: Superman Question: Superman is helping to build a new skyscraper by lifting heavy steel beams. Each beam weighs 1,200 pounds. If he lifts 50 beams to the top of the construction site in one day, how many pounds of steel has Superman lifted in that day?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Weight of one steel beam
    weight_per_beam = 1200
    # Number of beams lifted in a day
    beams_lifted = 50
    # Total weight lifted is the weight per beam multiplied by the number of beams
    total_weight_lifted = weight_per_beam * beams_lifted
    return total_weight_lifted
```

Running this function would give us the total weight lifted by Superman in pounds after lifting 50 beams.

    schools = 5
    # Action figures given to each school
    action_figures_per_school = 120
    # Total action figures distributed is the product of the number of schools and the number of action figures per school
    total_action_figures = schools * action_figures_per_school
    # The answer is
    return total_action_figures
```
Topic: Patrick Mahomes Question: In the first half of a football game, Patrick Mahomes threw for 150 yards. In the second half, he threw for double the yards he threw in the first half. How many total yards did Patrick Mahomes throw in the game?

Solution:
```python
def total_yards():
    # Patrick Mahomes threw for 150 yards in the first half
    first_half_yards = 150
    
    # In the second half, he threw for double the yards of the first half
    second_half_yards = first_half_yards * 2
    
    # The total yards is the sum of the yards from the first half and the second half
    total = first_half_yards + second_half_yards
    
    # Return the total yards
    return total

# Call the function to calculate the total yards thrown by Patrick Mahomes
print(total_yards())
```

When the `total_yards` function is called, it will calculate and return Patrick Mahomes' total throwing yards for the game, which is the sum of his first and second half yards. The `print` statement at the end will display the result.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of airplanes at the airport
    total_airplanes = 45
    # Number of cargo planes
    cargo_planes = 12
    # Calculating number of passenger planes by subtracting cargo planes from total
    passenger_planes = total_airplanes - cargo_planes
    # Number of passenger planes currently in the air
    passenger_planes_in_air = 8
    # Calculating number of passenger planes on the ground by subtracting those in the air
    passenger_planes_on_ground = passenger_planes - passenger_planes_in_air
    # The answer is
    return passenger_planes_on_ground
```

Running this Python function `solution()` would return the number of passenger planes on the ground at the airport.
Topic: unicorns ### Question:
In a magical forest, a group of unicorns is playing. There are 15 unicorns total. Some unicorns have purple manes while the rest have silver manes. If there are twice as many silver-maned unicorns as there are purple-maned unicorns, how many purple-maned unicorns are there?

### Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Total number of unicorns
    total_unicorns = 15
    # Let x be the number of purple-maned unicorns
    # Then the number of silver-maned unicorns is 2*x (since there are twice as many)
    # So the equation is: x + 2*x = total_unicorns
    # Solving for x we get: 3*x = total_unicorns
    # Now we divide both sides by 3 to find x
    purple_maned_unicorns = total_unicorns / 3
    return purple_maned_unicorns

# Calling the function
number_of_purple_maned_unicorns = solution()
print(f"There are {number_of_purple_maned_unicorns} purple-maned unicorns.")
```
This Python function calculates the number of purple-maned unicorns based on the provided information and returns the result.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Length of the pool
    pool_length = 50
    # Total laps required to complete the race
    total_laps = 20
    # Laps completed before the rest
    laps_completed = 12
    # Laps remaining after the rest
    laps_remaining = total_laps - laps_completed
    # Meters to swim to complete the race
    meters_remaining = laps_remaining * pool_length
    return meters_remaining

# Example call to the function:
remaining_distance = solution()
print(f"Michael needs to swim {remaining_distance} more meters to finish the race.")
```
This Python function starts by defining the length of the swimming pool and the total number of laps for the competition. It calculates the number of laps Michael has left after his rest and multiplies that by the pool's length to find out the remaining distance he has to swim.
Topic: cookies Question: Jenny baked 48 cookies and arranged them equally on 6 plates. Her friends came over and ate 3 plates' worth of cookies. How many cookies does Jenny have left?

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Jenny baked 48 cookies
    total_cookies = 48
    # The cookies are arranged on 6 plates equally
    plates = 6
    # This means each plate has this many cookies
    cookies_per_plate = total_cookies / plates
    # Her friends ate 3 plates' worth of cookies
    plates_eaten = 3
    # So the total number of cookies eaten is
    cookies_eaten = cookies_per_plate * plates_eaten
    # The number of cookies left is
    cookies_left = total_cookies - cookies_eaten
    return cookies_left
```
This Python function calculates the number of cookies left after Jenny's friends eat 3 plates of cookies. Here, we first calculate how many cookies are on each plate by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of plates. Then we multiply the number of cookies on each plate by how many plates were eaten to find out how many cookies were consumed. Finally, we subtract the eaten cookies from the total to get the number of remaining cookies.
Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams plays 5 tennis matches. She wins 4 of them and loses 1. If each match won gives her 3 points and a loss subtracts 1 point, how many points does she have after the 5 matches?

Solution:
```python
def serena_points():
    # Serena wins 4 matches, each win gives her 3 points
    matches_won = 4
    points_per_win = 3
    points_won = matches_won * points_per_win

    # She loses 1 match, each loss subtracts 1 point
    matches_lost = 1
    points_per_loss = -1
    points_lost = matches_lost * points_per_loss

    # The answer is
    total_points = points_won + points_lost
    return total_points
```

This function calculates the total points Serena Williams has after playing 5 tennis matches, taking into account both her wins and her loss.

    # Each Power Ranger can defeat 8 space monsters in an hour
    monsters_per_ranger_per_hour = 8
    # There are 5 Power Rangers
    number_of_rangers = 5
    # Total capacity of Power Rangers per hour
    total_monsters_defeated_per_hour = monsters_per_ranger_per_hour * number_of_rangers
    # There are 240 space monsters to defeat
    total_monsters = 240
    # Calculate the time it will take to defeat all monsters
    hours_needed = total_monsters / total_monsters_defeated_per_hour

Topic: Super Mario Question: Super Mario is on a quest to rescue Princess Peach and he needs to collect coins along the way. On the first level, he collects 120 coins. On the second level, he finds a secret area and doubles his total coins. In the third level, however, a Boo steals 30 of his coins. How many coins does Super Mario have after the third level?

Solution:
```python
def mario_coins():
    # Super Mario collects 120 coins on the first level
    coins_first_level = 120
    # On the second level, he doubles his coins
    coins_second_level = coins_first_level * 2
    # In the third level, a Boo steals 30 of his coins
    coins_stolen_by_boo = 30
    # The total coins he has after the third level is
    result = coins_second_level - coins_stolen_by_boo
    return result
```

Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. `coins_first_level = 120` sets the initial number of coins collected by Mario.
2. `coins_second_level = coins_first_level * 2` reflects Mario doubling his coins in the secret area.
3. `coins_stolen_by_boo = 30` represents the number of coins stolen by the Boo.
4. Finally, `result = coins_second_level - coins_stolen_by_boo` calculates Mario's total coin count after losing some to the Boo.

Solution:
```python
def solution():
    # Hello Kitty starts with 10 red bows
    red_bows = 10
    # and she also has 15 pink bows
    pink_bows = 15
    # She gives away 3 red bows to her friend Mimmy
    red_bows -= 3
    # and she gives away 5 pink bows to Mimmy
    pink_bows -= 5
    # Total bows remaining with Hello Kitty
    total_bows = red_bows + pink_bows
    # The answer is the total number of bows Hello Kitty has now
    return total_bows

# Uncomment the line below to test the function

    # Super Mario starts with 3 lives
    starting_lives = 3
    # Super Mario collects 400 coins
    coins_collected = 400
    # Every 100 coins give him an extra life
    coins_per_extra_life = 100
    # Calculating the number of extra lives earned
    extra_lives = coins_collected // coins_per_extra_life
    # Total lives Mario has at the end
    total_lives = starting_lives + extra_lives
    return total_lives

# Uncomment to test the function

```

This function will calculate the number of extra lives Super Mario earns by collecting coins and will return the total number of lives he has at the end of his coin-collecting adventure.
Topic: Serena Williams Question: Serena Williams played in two tennis tournaments. In the first tournament, she played 5 matches and won 4. In the second tournament, she played 7 matches and won 6. What is the total number of matches she played and what percentage of those matches did she win?

Solution:
```python
def serena_williams_stats():
    # Number of matches Serena Williams played in the first tournament
    matches_first_tournament = 5
    # Number of matches she won in the first tournament
    wins_first_tournament = 4
    
    # Number of matches she played in the second tournament
    matches_second_tournament = 7
    # Number of matches she won in the second tournament
    wins_second_tournament = 6
    
    # Total number of matches played is the sum of matches from both tournaments
    total_matches_played = matches_first_tournament + matches_second_tournament
    
    # Total number of matches won is the sum of wins from both tournaments
    total_matches_won = wins_first_tournament + wins_second_tournament
    
    # The percentage of matches won is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the total matches played and multiplying by 100
    win_percentage = (total_matches_won / total_matches_played) * 100
    
    # Returning a tuple with the total number of matches played and the win percentage
    return total_matches_played, win_percentage

# Call the function and print the results
total_played, percentage_won = serena_williams_stats()
print(f"Total matches played: {total_played}")
print(f"Percentage of matches won: {percentage_won:.2f}%")
```

In this Python function, we first calculate the total number of matches Serena Williams played by summing the matches from both tournaments. We do the same for the total number of wins. Then we calculate the win percentage by dividing the number of wins by the total number of matches played and converting the result to a percentage by multiplying by 100. We return both the total number of matches played and the win percentage, and we can print these values out to see the final result.
Topic: Superman ### Response:
Question: Superman is helping to build a new skyscraper. If he can lift 20 steel beams per hour and each beam weighs 2 tons, how many tons of beams can he lift in 5 hours?

Solution:
```python
def calculate_beams_lifted(hours):
    # Superman can lift 20 steel beams per hour
    beams_per_hour = 20
    # Each beam weighs 2 tons
    weight_per_beam = 2
    # He works for 5 hours
    total_beams = beams_per_hour * hours
    # Calculate the total weight of beams he can lift
    total_weight = total_beams * weight_per_beam
    return total_weight

# To solve for 5 hours
lifted_in_5_hours = calculate_beams_lifted(5)
print(f"Superman can lift {lifted_in_5_hours} tons of beams in 5 hours.")
```

Using this function will calculate the total weight of the steel beams Superman can lift in a given number of hours. When we pass the value 5 to the function, we get the total weight of beams he lifts in 5 hours.
