INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of transformers to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested huggingface_hub==0.16.4
    transformers 4.40.0 depends on huggingface-hub<1.0 and >=0.19.3

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
