python 2, 2  2 2 2 2  2 100
python version 3 2,  2 2 2 0.99  2 100
The reason for the two answers is that the percentage in the first line is a string in the second version, the first and the percentage is a float in the second (3.0), but the percentage is always multiplied by one, which does not matter because the percentage is always a valid value within 0 100. 
1. If you have an integer division, for example a / b, the result is another number. Python 2 returns the resulting integer, the Python version 3 returns the float.
2. The division / is not a correct operation between an integer and a floating point number, because the result is rounded to the next lower integer

Question: What percentage of the population of the human species knows what a code academy is?

Answer: It may vary from time to time, as the population would change and grow as the time passes, but according to Google, Code Academy has 33.1 million unique visitors over the past 30 days and 1.24 billion searches with an average of 4 billion searches monthly in 1998, and 4.9 billion searches annually. We can use the equation to find the percentage of the population that knows what a code academy is. (4 billion searches monthly/1.24 billion searches with an average in 1998) * 100 = 3228.125% of the population knows what a code academy is. (4 billion searches annually/1.24 billion searches with an average in 1998) * 100 = 257.58% of the population knows what a code academy is.

Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder ### Response:  Thor is 1/5 less dense than gold and 1/2 heavier than copper. He needs 400 lightning bolts. Given that he can hold 800 bolts at once in each hand, how many more bolts does he need to make up half the weight of a 200 lb bar of gold?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Thor weighs 200 lb, he is 1/5 as dense as gold, so.2 lb of thor = 1 lb of gold
    thor_weight =.2
    #Thor is 1/2 heavier than copper
    thor_copper_weight_ratio =.5
    gold_weight = 1
    #400 bolts
    bolts_count = 400
    #Each hand can hold 800 bolts at once
    hands_capacity = 800
    #The weight of one bolt is (total weight of hand - total weight of Thor) / capacity of hand
    bolt_weight = (thor_weight + hands_capacity) / hands_capacity
    #Thor needs 800 bolts, one hand weighs 400 * (thor_weight + 200 pounds / 800 pounds each), so the total weight of the hands is 2 * 400 * (th

    speed = 25.55
    
    #We find the vertical distance of the ball by first finding the initial velocity using sin
    #and then getting the vertical distance by using the formula for the distance formula
    initial_velocity = math.sin(math.radians(angle)) * speed
    vertical_distance = initial_velocity * math.pow(2,2) + (math.pow(initial_altitude,2) / 2)

Questions: This is the week where we do our math word problem assignments. We also will be looking at how to make a "shopping list" of ingredients for a recipe by "shopping" the grocery store and having some fun here. What that means is that you have to go into the grocery store, and using the list of ingredients for a famous dish, you will have to choose the right ingredients that you find. This means thinking about what ingredient you want to get first and which ones can be on the shelf behind the one you are holding? How do you know if they "match"? How can you create a shopping list of ingredients at the grocery store to know that you have what you need? Are there any questions about the assignment? 1. Use the information from the grocery store, the shopping list of ingredients, and the Python function to create a shopping list of ingredients. 2. Use if/elif statements to check if the ingredient is on the shelf. 3. Check if the ingredient is in the shopping list of ingredients. 4. Return the ingredient. 5. Calculate the number of each ingredient remaining. 6. Calculate the total number of ingredients remaining.

Topic: trains ### Response:  ### Question: If the engineer starts the train, then travels 20 mph, and the conductor runs to the end of the train in 10 seconds, how many seconds will it take to reach maximum train speed of 40 mph?
### Solution: 
def solution():
    #The engineer starts the train
    seconds_to_train_speed = time_to_travel(0, 20, distance_between_end_and_start)
    #The conductor runs to the end of the train
    time_for_conductor = run(train_length, train_speed)
    #It takes seconds_to_train_speed seconds to reach train speed
    return seconds_to_train_speed + time_for_conductor
##Explanation:

## The engineer starts the train, so it is at rest during the time it takes to reach the full train speed. 

## Since the train starts from rest, it's final speed is reached by calculating the average speed: 

distance = time to reach a speed * speed

## The speed of the train is going to be 40 mph. 

## The time it takes for the conductor to run the length of the train, starting at the last train car at 0 seconds until reaching the engine at the time where train speed is reached is 10 seconds

Topic: Steph Curry ### Response: 5:29 - 5:33, 10:20 - 10:31, 20:20 - 20:31
Curry makes 70 shots from the field, 21 from the free throw line
His points scored (shots) is 123 and his points from free throws is 21
His points from the field is 102
The average of shots is 60 (70 + 21)
The average of points is 72
The average of free throws is 20 (21 + 21)
20 (shots) x 1 (free throw percentage for 1 sth out of 3 attempts) = 20 points scored out of 60 attempts
60 (shots) - 20 (points scored out of 3 attempts) = 40 shots made out of 60
40 (shots) x 1 (field goal percentage) = 40 points scored out of 60
40 + 20 = 60 points scored out of 60 attempts
5 * 123 = 615

Topic: Minecraft ### Response:  Question: You have a Minecraft farm with 3 pigs, and 5 carrots. When you make a pig steak, it takes 4 carrots and keeps the pig alive for 100 days. How many pig steaks can you make with your pig, and how long will the pig live before it dies?
Solution:
def solution():
    #You start with 3 pigs and 5 carrots
    pigs = 3
    carrots = 5
    #It takes 4 carrots to make a pig steak
    pig_steaks = carrots / 4
    #And it will keep the pig alive for 100 days
    days_pig_lives = 100
    #Add that up to find out how many pig steaks you can make
    pig_steaks += days_pig_lives
    #Now, you have a total of 5 carrots and 3 + X days for your pig to live
    total_carrots = pigs * pig_steaks
    #What X is
    x = 5 - total_carrots
    #Finally, to finish the question, we need to find out that a total of 3 pigs can live for 100 + X days.

Topic: soccer ### Response: 1) Question: A soccer player kicks a ball as hard as he can to launch it from the half way line toward their opponent's goal. The ball is kicked such that if the ball were to continue flying in the air with that same velocity (speed and angle with respect to the ground) it would hit the back of the net, which would be equivalent to the ball traveling a total of 92.5 meters toward the goal. However, because of the curvature in the shape of the playing field, the ball in fact doesn't hit the back of the net, but instead comes to a stop at the goal line. How far is this?
Solution:

The player to get 3 of their own markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner. So on any given turn, there are three possible outcomes: a win, a loss, or a tie. At the end of each turn, the players should print a line with a message indicating what just happened.

Note: A soccer ball is approximately 8.5 cm in diameter.
Solution:
def solution():

    ball_diameter = 8.5
    #The surface area of a sphere is 4 * pi * radius^2
    surface_area = 4 * pi * ball_diameter**2

The armor frame requires 1/3 as much gold that the collected gold as the collection. Iron Man has placed 9/16 of the armor frame gold on the ground for measuring and safety. How much gold is in the armored frame?
Solution:
def solution():
    #24 tons of gold are collected
    gold = 24
    #1/3 as much gold is in the armored suit as the gold collected
    armor_gold = 1/3 * gold
    #The armor suit is made up of 1.5 gold frames
    frames = 1.5
    #1.5 * 1/3 =.5
    armory_gold = gold - armor_gold - (frames * armor_gold)
    #9/16 of the armor suit is on the floor for measuring and safety
    floor_gold = 9/16 * armory_gold
    #The answer is
    result = armory_gold - floor_gold

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 3 questions:
Question 1:
We used to build bridges and build cities. It was time consuming and took decades.
We had the power and the ability but did not have the desire. Why wait to do our work when we can just do it the easy way?
Nowadays we make a lot of things like chairs and tables, cars and trains, houses and buildings, computers and phones, books and movies, restaurants and stores, and even warships and battleships.
We used to do all of this work by hand. It was hard and time consuming. We did not know how to make new things without a lot of hard work and a lot of time. In the old days we did everything without modern technology. Not anymore.
We have new technology that allows us to make new things without much effort. We make new things in hours, days, or weeks compared to the old days when we used to spend months or even years to make something like a car or a computer or a cell phone or a modern building, a new book or a new restaurant.
Nowadays we make most of the things we need by using the new technology of the 21st century. We make new things with more innovation, faster, easier, and cheaper

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response:  Question: 

The NFL season is about to begin!

As football fans, we should consider the probability of a specific outcome.

Each team in the NFL has a 1 in 8 chance to win the Super Bowl! We would assume that everyone is equally likely to win.

However, a recent analysis has determined that quarterback skill level has a considerable impact on the ability to win the Super Bowl.

For example, Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs has been consistently proven to be a top-rated quarterback across different measurements such as touchdown passes, interception percentage, and passer rating.

Let's consider Patrick Mahomes' chances of winning the Super Bowl over his first three years.

As mentioned previously, every team in the NFL has a 1 in 8 chance to win the Super Bowl.

However, Patrick Mahomes has won the Super Bowl twice over his career.

This begs the question, what happens when we consider that Patrick Mahomes is playing for one of the best teams in the league with an improved passing offense to boot?

The Chiefs have an additional probability of 0.45 chance of winning based on the improvement of Mahomes' past performance.

As a result, there is a 0.45 x 1.125 + 1 in

However, he thinks we all need a little more technology in our names, so he created code-names, or coding-names, for each of his children, based on the code he uses for each of the precious stones. Each child's coding-name is the Unicode hex value (base 16) of each letter of their precious stone name.
For example, his 11th child, Ruby, has the coding-name for Ruby, which is 52 (0x32 in base 16), where "5" is the Unicode hex value of "R", and "2" is the Unicode hex value of "u".
Because you're his advisor and he loves you, he asked you to write a Python function and a test to solve two problems.

Solution:
I'm not quite sure what it means to be 4 for 4 in basketball, but I'll try to explain this as best I can. First off, 4 for 4 means an athlete makes 4 attempts at something and converts all 4 tries. For instance, in baseball, a hitter going up to bat 4 times will need to be 4 for 4 to hit a perfect 4 for 4.
LeBron's scoring average of 10 points per game in the 2015-2016 season can be broken down into an explanation of how LeBron averaged 10 points per game overall, as well as specific instances during the season where he went into a game and scored exactly 4 points out of the 4 times he was able to take shots. For example, let's look at his game stats for December 9, 2015 against the Denver Nuggets. LeBron took 17 shots during the

Question: There are 20 million pizza slices in New York. 80% of those are sold in less than an hour from when they arrive at the store. 1000 slices are sold after an hour. How many slices are left after an hour?
Solution:
The number of sliced pizza in New York = 20 million

### Explanation:
The "while loop" continues as long as the "expression" evaluates to true. The number 100 is assigned to the value of "count" at the beginning of the loop. The "count" is decremented at the end of the loop. Therefore, the loop will continue until "count" is decremented all the way to zero. It will then stop because "count" will no longer be less than the number 5.

If an average human life span is 82 years, how old would Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to be so that there were more than 10 times the number of years between Hermione's and Ron's ages as there are between Hermione's and Harry's ages?
Solution:
def solution():
    Harry, Ron, and Hermione are 11 years old, so they are the same age.

Topic: planes ### Response:  Question: Two planes fly to different cities. The first plane left 15 minutes after the second plane and traveled at a constant speed of 300 miles per hour. When the first plane reached its destination, it had flown for 4.5 hours. How many hours did it take the second plane to reach its destination?
Solution:
def solution():
    #First plane took off 15 minutes after
    time_taken_to_takeoff = 0.25
    #The difference is calculated
    time_diff = time_taken_to_takeoff
    #Difference between the first plane's speed
    speed_difference = 300
    #The distance traveled
    distance = speed_difference * time_diff
    #The second plane's distance traveled
    second_plane_distance = distance * 3.75
    #The answer
    result = second_plane_distance

Topic: volleyball ### Response:  Volleyball
A player serves at a speed of 50 miles per hour. His serves usually go over the net at angles ranging from 6 to 25 degrees. However, he occasionally has difficulty because the opponent is standing too close to the net and blocks much of the player's swing. It is a mistake for the player to compensate by hitting the volleyball with a steeper angle, but he is too upset with himself to change his game. The block was so severe that the ball was served with a 28-degree angle. How far did the ball travel before it went out of bounds?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Volleyball speed
    speed = 50
    #Range of angles

## Programming in a Web-based Environment
The programming environment that we use will be something that most people are familiar with: the console and/or command window. This is the traditional programming environment. In this environment, you interact with your computer one task at a time, type statements into your computer and wait for a result. 

## Your Computer
Your computer, your operating system (Windows, OS X, Linux), your hardware (how much RAM, how fast a CPU, how many cores), and your software (what software you've installed, specifically the Python installation and how it is configured), all impact the speed and behavior of your code.

## Environment Setup and Configuration
We'll use a special command-line tool to ensure the same Python environment

In one year, he flew 240,000 miles, drove 1,200 miles, swam 8,000 meters, ran 18,000 miles, and used his repulsor gauntlets 1,500 times. In total, how many miles did he go and how many times did he use his repulsor gauntlets?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Iron Man started up his heart
    time = 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60
    #He flew 240,000 miles
    miles_flying = time * 240000

    miles_driving = 1200
    #Swam 8,000 meters
    miles_sweating = time * 8000 / 1000 / 1.61
    #Ran 18,000 miles
    miles_running = time * 18000
    #Used repulsor gauntlets 1,500 times

Solution:
def solution():

    #         This means we will have 1.5 - 0.5 = 1.0 meters left to cross.
    #Step 3: We then have to repeat the step from step 2. This means take half a meter steps again until
    #         we reach the line. We will have 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5 meters left to cross.

Topic: candy ### Response: 25 gummy bears were counted. All but 3 gummy bears were blue. If there are 22 blue gummy bears, how many gummy bears are orange and white?
Solution:
def solution():
    #I have 25 gummy bears
    gummy_bears_total = 25
    #All but 3 are blue
    gummy_bears_blue = gummy_bears_total - 3
    #There are 22 blue gummy bears

    #The answer is
    gummy_bears_not_blue = int(gummy_bears_total - gummy_bears_blue_actual)

Note: The number of total gummy bears should equal the number of blue gummy bears plus the number of orange and white gummy bears. For each blue gummy bear, the number of orange and white gummy bears increases by 1. This formula can be used to determine the number of orange and white gummy bears:
Orange and white gummy bears = Total gummy bears minus the number of blue gummy bears.

Topic: football ### Response:  Question: Jason is on a football team with 20 players. Jason's position is wide receiver. Three quarters of all the players on the team play defense. Four fifths of all the players on the team play offense. You could write this information in the following diagram:
![Image](resources/images/question_2_5_1.png)
Jason's position is wide receiver and he is in the box that has a football next to it. To find the number that represents wide receivers who are on offense, you can add the three blue squares (representing wide receivers) to the four orange squares (representing the part of the team that is on offense), resulting in a total of seven. To find the number that represents wide receivers who are going to be on the defensive team, you can add the three blue squares and the one brown square, resulting in a total of four. This means that 4 players on the team are wide receivers that play offense and 20 - 4 = 16 players on the team are wide receivers that play defense. Therefore, 16 / 20 = 0.8, which equals 80%, So 80% of wide receivers play defense.

And there's some people that he knows that like the way that he changes.  So, I think his next move is to change and to keep changing, so he can take care of more people.  I think that he should change his suit, so that people will think that he's still in the suit, but he's not.  I think that's the key.

Topic: candy ### Response:  Question: 
 12 children in a classroom have between 2 and 6 pieces of candy in their book bag. 
 If each child gives someone else at least 1 piece of their candy, then the distribution of candy pieces after exchanging is 1)uniformly random OR 2)does not change (stay the same).
 What is the probability that the children still have a uniform distribution of candy pieces after they have passed out at least 1 piece?
 Note: This is a conditional probability question. 
 It is not a simple answer of 50% or 100%. 
 You will need to incorporate the given probability of the random variable that is the distribution of candy pieces prior to the passing out of some of their pieces.
 Please show your work and explain your approach.
Hint Hint: This is NOT a simple conditional probability problem.
First, you must find the probability that the number of candies remaining is uniformly distributed, i.e uniform.  
There are 12 candies to start.  6 + (7/2) + (8/3) + (9/4) + (10/5) + (11/6) = 24.75 candies remain after exchanging, which is not uniformly distributed.

Each player has to stand on their toes with one leg raised at all times. 
This puts enough stress on the player that it only takes one second before one of the three hundred players falls over. 
When the one-player falls over, it takes another one second, per player, for all players  to stop wobbling. 
However, all players start to wobble again as soon as they've all stopped.

Topic: pizza ### Response:  A restaurant sells pizzas with 3 toppings. The total number of pizzas sold is 6 + 15x + 5x^2. How many pizza do they have if 13 pizzas are sold, 8 of which had 3 toppings? (You should be able to answer this question without coding just by looking at the formula.)
Solution:  A function is not needed because the answer can be seen and calculated mentally:  The total number of pizzas sold is 6 + 15x + 5x^2. We set x = 3, giving us 6 + 45 +9 = 60 pizzas with 3 toppings. Therefore the other 13 pizza with 3 toppings are among the remaining 6 + 15x + 5x^2 = 6 + 45 + 9 = 42 pizzas with 1 or 2 toppings.

Topic: football ### Response: 1) Question: What is the expected number of yards gained after the ball is in place?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The kickoff has a 40 yard line placement. We assume this is our starting point
    start_yards = 40
    #The field goal and field goal block are both scored if we make it into the endzone. The field goal attempt has a 32 yard line placement. Field goal block has a 10 yard line placement. An endzone hit has a 0 yard line placement.
    field_goal_place = 32
    field_goal_block_place = 10
    endzone_place = 0
    #All three of these options can occur, and the endzone hit is the closest to the start yard line. The formula that tells us how many yard lines there are between two given numbers is below, where a is the greater yard line, and b is the lesser yard line. We subtract the lesser yard line from the greater yard line and add 1. This gives us the number of 10 yard line intervals between the number. We add this number to the lesser yard line. This solution has been tested in the following example:

Then, you will loop through a number of rows to assign each cheerleader to a seat. The rows are numbered from 0 to 6 to match up with each cheerleader's position in the list. You will store the number of rows in a variable called num_rows.

Here's the steps you'll take for the cheerleaders to move into their seats after finding their starting point in the list.

1. Loop through the rows from 0 to num_rows. This creates rows of 7 seats each.
2. Add each row's starting point to a variable called row_start to mark where each row starts.
3. Each row consists of seats. You determine the numbers for those seats by adding

Topic: soccer ### Response:  Question: Alex Morgan was the first person to score a goal at the Women's World Cup in France. She scored 3 goals in 6 matches. What is her goal average, rounded to 2 decimal places?
Soccer matches have 90 minutes of play in a match, but soccer matches stop for injury time. Some matches end in extra-time and a penalty shootout if necessary. However, we assume the match clock starts at zero and stops at 90. 

Alex played 6 matches during the World Cup. She scored a 0:00 goal in the first match, a 90:00 goal in the second match, and a 0:00 goal in the third match.  She did not score any goals in the fourth match.  She scored two 90:00 goals in the fifth match against England, and a first-minute 00:00 goal in the 6th match against Sweden. 

Solution:
def solution():
    #Alex Morgan was the first person to score a goal at the Women's World Cup in France.
    first_goal_time = 0.000
    #She scored three goals in six matches, so her goal average is:

def solution():
    #Diameter is twice the radius, so the radius is half the diameter, which is 8.9/2
    radius = 4.45 inches
    #Now we need to find the square of radius, which is 4.45^2
    radius_squared = radius**2
    #Now the number of courts wide that the basketball will be is the square root of the square of radius squared.
    basketball = math.sqrt(radius_squared)
    #That is the answer
    return basketball
2. Question: What is the probability that a 6.7" ball will fit in a container that can fit up to a 8.2" basketball? (To calculate the probability, divide the probability that the ball fits into the container by the probability that you roll that size ball.)
Solution:
def solution():
    #A 6.7" ball is a smaller radius ball than an
    #8.2" ball, so the probability that the first ball
    #fits in the container and not the second one
    first

Topic: Super Mario ### Response:  Question: The princess has been kidnapped and is locked inside the dungeon. The dungeon is 150 units away from Super Mario's current location. You have to write a function which calculates Super Mario's distance from the dungeon and whether he is closer to the dungeon than previously. For example, Super Mario's initial distance from the dungeon was 60 units and then he moves 75 units towards the dungeon. That function should return true because the Super Mario moved 15 units closer. There would be a test case that passes the initial distance as 50 and the move towards the dungeon as 45. In this case, Super Mario would be further away from the dungeon, therefore, that function should return false. And there would be another test case that passes both values as 150. In this case, Super Mario would pass the dungeon, therefore, that function should return true. 
Solution:
def solution():
    #The princess has been kidnapped and is locked inside the dungeon.

    #The dungeon is 150 units away from Super Mario's current location.

The top team is Real Madrid with 11 wins, followed by Barcelona with 7 wins, Atlético Madrid with 5 wins, and Valencia with 5 wins. From the other 8 teams, the next best team and the worst team are tied for fifth place. The next to worst teams are ranked 7th and 8th. 2 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw (tie). Write a function called get_squad_points to get the points for a squad based on these rules. The function should take two arguments, squad and scores, where squad is a list of 12 teams and scores is a list of 12 integers in the same order as squad. The scores list contains the win/loss/draw point totals for each squad member (win is represented by 2, draw is represented by 1, and loss is represented by 0). The output of the function should be a list of 12 integers in the same order as the squads. The integers in the output list are the points earned by each squad based on the scores they got and the rule that the 4th place
Topic: soccer ### Response:  Question: During the World Cup, 10 teams are in each group, with the exception of Group A, which only has eight teams. Every team plays every other team in the group. In Group B, each team plays another team of its own group three times. How many times does the team from Group B play a team from its own group in the end of the World Cup?
Solution: 
def solution():
    # 10 teams are in each group of the World Cup
    teams_by_group = 10
    # The only exception is Group A, which only has 8 teams
    teams_in_groupA = 8
    # Therefore, we can calculate the total number of teams by summing the remaining groups along with group A
    total_teams = teams_by_group * 7 + teams_in_groupA
    # Every team plays every other team in the group
    pairs_per_group = teams_by_group * (teams_by_group - 1)
    # In Group B, each team plays another team of its own group 3 times
    triples_per_group = teams_by_group * (teams_by_group - 1) * 3
    # How many times does the team in Group B

Topic: Steph Curry ### Response:  Question: Step Curry has the lowest three-point field goal percentage in 2018. Last season he shot 41.58% from downtown. The next guy who shot 41.5% is Harrison Barnes. But in the finals, he shot 46.67% from three. If he shoots at the same three point field goal percentage every game, how many games will it take him to break his all-time record?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Last season he scored 41.58% from three
    regular_season_field_goals =.4158
    #In the final's he shot 46.67%

Topic: Hello Kitty ### Response: 3.5
3.5 is the answer to the question: Hello Kitty made a profit of 100 on buying her first house. She had her friend help her to pay a mortgage of 75 per month, but after 8 months she decided to repay her friend with a monthly payment of 25 (which equaled the extra payment she would have had to pay on her house if she were paying it off herself). How many months did it take Hello Kitty to make her house completely her own? (hint, it took at least 1.75 months...). Here is the math: First, I wrote the equation 75x + 100 = 25(y + x) where, x = time (in months), and y = monthly payment Hello Kitty paid to cover her debt. To get my first answer, I set x = 8, which gives me the equation 75(8) + 100 = 25(y + x), and solve for y: 620 = 25(y + 8), 620 = 25y + 200, 420 = 25y, y = 16.8 which tells me her friend paid a grand total of 16.8, which means

Topic: Minecraft ### Response: 1: How many blocks are available to players when first starting a new game of Minecraft?
Solution:
We start on a Minecraft map with 64 blocks, and the sides are all made of grass. The top layer of grass is dirt. The next layer is dirt too, but one block deep. Under that is stone which has four layers. The next layer is air and is one block deep. Under that is water which is 1 block deep. Then you have lava which is one block deep. On top of water there are 6 blocks, so top layer water plus lava equals 7 blocks. Also, a block's height is 1.5 blocks tall in the default setting. The only way to get more blocks is to obtain them by placing certain objects in the game. There are also several kinds of food that can be made.

Write two python functions; one that will find the month in the format of a number (e.g. 6 for June) and the second will find the month in the format of a word (e.g. June). The main program should take the age of the cat in months and the gender (MALE or FEMALE) of the owner, and return the age of the cat in "human years" (month or word) in the following format:

#### 1. For male human owners, the Python function which takes age of cat in months produces age of cat in months. The function which takes age of cat in months as an argument uses it to calculate the age of the cat in human years, in terms of months, and returns a formatted string of the form "<human name> is X months old in human years" where X equals the difference between the age of the cat and the median age of a human at that time. The program should first calculate the age of the cat in human months. For 12 months, the age of the cat in months is 1.8 times the age of a human at that time

Topic: trains ### Response:  Question: You have 100 bags each containing 10 small metal cubes. Each cube has a value of \$5. The owner of the cubes asks you to move some of them while keeping the total value the same.
You have two kinds of trains to do this. Each train of type 1 can carry 2 bags of cubes simultaneously, each bag of cubes from a different bag. Each train of type 2 can carry 5 bags of cubes simultaneously, but each of these bags must be from a single bag. For simplicity, assume that the owner of the cubes likes 5's (fives), so the first bag of cubes must have a total value of \$5, the second bag of cubes must have a total value of \$10,...
What is the fewest number of trains of each type that you need to be able to move all the cubes?
Solution:
def solution():
    #There are 100 bags
    bags_total = 100
    #Each bag has 10 small metal cubes
    cubes_per_bag = 10
    #The total value for each cube is $5.00

Topic: Pokémon ### Response:  Question: 

Ash and his Pikachu are back at the Pokémon Center charging after Pikachu was hurt in their battle with the Tyrantrum. Ash and Pikachu see a bunch of Pokémon playing on a field. They also see other people playing Pokémon Go. Unfortunately, the two Pokémon that Ash and Pikachu like the most from the bunch are missing: an Excadrill and a Goomy, to be specific. Ash figures that if he were to look at his Pokédex while looking for the two Pokémon on his radar, all he needs to find is one. One Pokémon is always greater than zero. If there are many of the desired Goomy around the field, then finding one of them can be considered easy since the other Goomy must all be greater than the first Goomy seen. 

a. Write a Python program that uses a function to solve the following problem:

Given a number of Goomy present and a number of Excadrill present, what is the probability that the two Goomy of choice are to be found? One Pokémon is always greater than zero; no greater than the first Goomy seen.

Topic: swimming ### Response:  Question: You are a lifeguard at the pool during the summer. 

There were 8 people in the group in front of you. 

There’s a long line behind you though, so you won’t know when you will be called on next without looking in the pool again. 

You know you should never take your eyes off the water. 

How can you predict in general what the next number you will call on will be?
Note from the instructor: You do not need to use Python to answer this question, even though you are building a problem solving function. The solution may look something like:
def solution():
    #You are a lifeguard at the pool during the summer.
    total_people = 8 #There were 8 people in the group in front of you.
    #There’s a long line behind you though, so you won’t know when you will be called on next without looking
    #in the pool again. You know you should never take your eyes off the water.
    #How can you predict in general what the next number you call on will be?
    #The total number of people in front is the next number I will call on minus the previous one

Topic: Serena Williams ### Response:  Serena Williams is a famous tennis player. She is 7 feet tall.

1. Write a line of code that compares her height to the height of Michael Jordan, who is 6 feet tall, and reports back whether she's taller or shorter than him.

2. Write a function called my_height() that calls this function, and returns the answer.

Solution:
def my_height(jordan_height):
    if jordan_height > serena_height:
        return jordan_height > serena_height
    else:
        return serena_height > jordan_height
def my_height(jordan_height):
    if jordan_height < serena_height:
        return jordan_height < serena_height
    else:
        return serena_height < jordan_height

In the above code, we use the variable'serena_height = 7', and 'jordan_height = 6'. 

We use an 'if' statement to check if Serena's height is greater than Michael Jordan's height. If not, we check if her height is less than Jordan's. If that's not true, we report that they are equal.

Question: The local candy company produces two types of candy, gummy bears and candy necklaces. They have the same weight but differ in size and shape. They produce gummy bears in a 6x6 grid, and candy necklaces in a 3x3 square. Gummy bears always come in an unbroken grid of the same size. Candy necklaces come in whole packs and sometimes in packets where a small segment of the necklace is missing, or in broken half-packs or in smaller broken segment pieces. All the candy comes in a wrapper, so the weight and shape cannot be determined by looking at the candy itself. The factory has a conveyor belt that transports all types of candy.

Question: Can we solve two expressions to one?
We use the concept of inverse operations.
Question: In a bag, there is 20% of oranges.
I want to find that number (x).
We use the inverse operation as 20% is negative and inverse operation is negative.
Inverse operation of 20% is -5.
Therefore, -0.5 * x = 20
Multiply both sides by -2.
x = -40.
Question: What percentage are there now?
Therefore,
x = -40. / 0.8
x = -50.

Topic: field hockey ### Response:  Question: 
There are 60 players on our field hockey team. Our goalie left to play for the NHL. We are recruiting a goalie. There are 25 kids who love field hockey but don't play. 
1/2 of the kids who love field hockey want to be goalies. 
The remaining kids are divided equally between playing defense and playing forwards. How many kids do we need to recruit to be goalies?
Solution: (Code goes Here)
The number of players on the field hockey team is 60.

We then subtract 1 from that, which leaves us with 59.

To find the number who want to be goalies, we multiply 59 by 0.5 (one half), which gives us 29.55.

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get 30 kids that want to be goalies.

From here we subtract this number from 60, which gives us 30 kids that have been divided evenly between defenders and forwards.

As the kids at each position are identical, we can half the answer to get 15 defenders, giving us 7 forwards.

Adding 7 to 30, we get 37 kids that play all other positions.

We then multiply this by
