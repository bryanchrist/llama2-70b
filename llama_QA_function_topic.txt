### Response: Question: A 12-foot-long and 10-foot-wide carpet is to be placed in a 16-foot-long and 14-foot-wide room. How much of the floor in the room will be carpeted? Solution: def solution():
    #The carpet is 12 feet long and 10 feet wide
    carpet_length = 12
    carpet_width = 10
    #The room is 16 feet long and 14 feet wide
    room_length = 16
    room_width = 14
    #The area of the carpet is
    carpet_area = carpet_length * carpet_width
    #The area of the room is
    room_area = room_length * room_width
    #The percentage of the room that will be carpeted is
    percent_carpeted = (carpet_area / room_area) * 100
### Response: Question: Superman can run at a speed of 2000 miles per hour. He can also fly at a speed of 5000 miles per hour. If he is in a race with Batman, who can only run at a speed of 100 miles per hour, and the race is 1000 miles long, how many hours will it take for Superman to cross the finish line if he:

1. Runs for the first 400 miles, then flies for the rest of the race?
2. Flies for the first 400 miles, then runs for the rest of the race?

Solution:
def superman_race():
    # Superman's running and flying speeds
    superman_run_speed = 2000
    superman_fly_speed = 5000

    # Batman's running speed
    batman_run_speed = 100

    # Race distance
    race_distance = 1000

    # Time for Superman to run 400 miles
    superman_run_time = 400 / superman_run_speed

    # Time for Superman to fly 600 miles
    superman_fly_time = (race_distance - 400) / superman_fly_speed

    # Total time for Superman to run 400 miles and then fly the rest of the race
    total_time_1 = superman_run_time + superman_fly_time

    # Time for Superman to fly 400 miles
    superman_fly_time_2 = 400 / superman_fly_speed

    # Time for Superman to run
### Response: Question: Superman can leap 1000 feet in a single bound.  If he leaps 500 feet to the right, and 500 feet to the left, how many feet from his starting point is he? Solution: def solution():
    #Superman leaped 500 feet to the right and 500 feet to the left
    leap_right = 500
    leap_left = 500
    #The answer is
    result = leap_right - leap_left
    return result

### Instruction:
Write a grade school math word problem about Batman and Python function with a commented out step-by-step solution to solve the word problem.

### Response: Question: Batman can run at a top speed of 150 mph.  He chases the Riddler for 1000 feet.  How long does it take him to catch the Riddler, in seconds? (1 mph is 1.466667 feet per second) Solution: def solution():
    #Batman's top speed is 150 mph
    batman_top_speed = 150
    #1 mph is 1.466667 feet per second
    mph_to_feet = 1.466667
    #He chases the Riddler for 1000 feet
    chase_distance = 1000
    #The answer is
    result = chase_distance / (batman_top_speed * mph_to_feet)

### Response: Question: Superman can fly at a speed of 3,000 miles per hour. He is 1,500 miles from the North Pole.  He flies at 3,000 miles per hour for 1 hour.  How many more hours does he need to fly to get to the South Pole? Solution: def solution():
    #Superman is 1,500 miles from the North Pole
    miles_from_north_pole = 1500
    #He can fly 3,000 miles per hour
    miles_per_hour = 3000
    #He flies for 1 hour
    hours_flown = 1
    #The answer is
    result = miles_from_north_pole - (miles_per_hour * hours_flown)
    return result

### Response: Question: 2004 was the first year that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 86 years. 2013 was the second time the Red Sox won the World Series in the 21st century. How many years later will the Red Sox next win the World Series?
Solution:
# 2004 was the first year that the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 86 years
# 2013 was the second time the Red Sox won the World Series in the 21st century
# The years are 86 years and 9 years apart, respectively.
# The average of these years is
average_years = (86 + 9) / 2
# The next time the Red Sox will win the World Series is
next_win = 2013 + average_years
# The answer is
result = next_win - 2013
