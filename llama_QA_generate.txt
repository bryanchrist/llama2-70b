Prompting Approach: zero shot. Generated Text: Your word problem should include the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The word problem should be solvable by a 4th grader.
In addition to solving the word problem, your program should also print the steps it took to solve the problem.
For example, if the word problem is “What is the sum of 123 and 456”, the program should print the following:
123 + 456 = 579
This means that the program first added 123 and 456, and then it printed the result.
Your program should be able to handle any word problem that can be solved by a 4th grader.
The word problem and the Python program should be submitted as a single file.
