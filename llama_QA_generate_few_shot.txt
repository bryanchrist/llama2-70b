A flock of 12 cranes was flying in a V formation. 
The flock leader crane at the point of the V formation flapped its wings once every second. 
The 2 cranes behind the leader, one on each side of the V formation, flapped their wings in unison with the leader. 
The 2 cranes behind them, one on each side of the V formation, flapped their wings at the same time, but on the half-beat of the leader and his two flanking cranes. 
The 2 cranes behind them, one on each side of the V formation, flapped their wings at the same time, but on the quarter-beat of the leader and his two flanking cranes.
