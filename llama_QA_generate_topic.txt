Prompting Approach: few shot. Generated Text: ### Response: Question: A pizza parlor sells small, medium, and large pizzas.  A small pizza has 6 slices, a medium pizza has 10 slices, and a large pizza has 14 slices.  How many slices of pizza will you get if you order 2 small, 3 medium, and 1 large pizza?
Solution:
# define the number of slices in each pizza
small_pizza_slices = 6
medium_pizza_slices = 10
large_pizza_slices = 14

# calculate the total number of slices
total_slices = 2 * small_pizza_slices + 3 * medium_pizza_slices + 1 * large_pizza_slices

Prompting Approach: few shot. Generated Text: ### Response: Question: In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt. However, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt, while Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round. If the total number of eggs in the pile they were collecting with 6 other people was 400 eggs, and Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second egg hunt round, find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected?
Solution:
# define the variables
tank_first_round = 0
emma_first_round = 0
tank_second_round = 0
emma_second_round = 60
total_eggs = 400
other_hunters = 6

# from the problem, we know that:
# Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in their second round of egg hunt
tank_second_round = emma_second_round / 2

# Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round
tank_first_round = tank_second_round + 20

# In April, Tank gathered 10 more Easter eggs than Emma in their first round of egg hunt
emma_first_round = tank_first_round - 10

# calculate the total number of eggs gathered by Tank and Emma
total_tank_emma = tank_first_round + emma_first_round + tank_second_round + emma_second_round

# find the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected
eggs_other_hunters = total_eggs - total_tank_emma
