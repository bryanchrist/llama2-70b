Question: 
A farmer is selling his cows. He has 20 cows in total. He sells 1/4 of them for $300 each, and he sells 1/2 of them for $250 each. How much money does the farmer make in total?
Solution:
# define the variables
total_cows = 20
sell_1_price = 300
sell_2_price = 250

# calculate the number of cows sold for each price
cows_sell_1 = total_cows / 4
cows_sell_2 = total_cows / 2

Prompting Approach: zero shot. Generated Text: The cafeteria sells 200 lunches a day. 1/4 of the lunches are wasted. 1/2 of the lunches are sold to 3rd graders. 1/5 of the lunches are sold to 5th graders. 1/10 of the lunches are sold to 6th graders. How many lunches are sold to 4th graders?

# number of lunches sold
lunches_sold = 200

# lunches wasted
wasted_lunches = lunches_sold / 4

# lunches sold to 3rd graders
third_grade_lunches = lunches_sold / 2

# lunches sold to 5th graders
fifth_grade_lunches = lunches_sold / 5

# lunches sold to 6th graders
sixth_grade_lunches = lunches_sold / 10

# lunches sold to 4th graders
fourth_grade_lunches = lunches_sold - wasted_lunches - third_grade_lunches - fifth_grade_lunches - sixth_grade_lunches

# print the number of lunches sold to 4th graders
print(int(fourth_grade_lunches))
