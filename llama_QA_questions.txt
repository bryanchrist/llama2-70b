Topic: Thor ### Response: Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, is a very busy man. He has to protect Asgard, Midgard, and all the other -gards. He is also in charge of the Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connects all the -gards. Thor is a very powerful god, but he is also very forgetful. He often forgets to close the Bifrost after he is done using it. This is a problem because the Bifrost is a one-way bridge. If Thor leaves it open, anyone can travel from one -gard to another. This is a security risk, as there are many beings in the -gards who would love to invade Asgard and take over. To solve this problem, Thor has installed a security system on the Bifrost. The security system will close the Bifrost automatically after a certain amount of time. Thor can also close the Bifrost manually. The security system has a timer that can be set to any number of minutes. Thor sets the timer to 10 minutes. This means that if he forgets to close the Bifrost, it will close automatically after 10 minutes.
