### Response: Question: 23456789 is a 9-digit number. How many 8-digit numbers can be formed by rearranging the 9 digits of 23456789? Solution:

# 23456789 is a 9-digit number.
# The number of 8-digit numbers that can be formed by rearranging the 9 digits is 9! / (9-8)!

# 9! is the factorial of 9, which is 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1
# (9-8)! is the factorial of 9-8, which is 1

# So, we can calculate 9! / (9-8)! as:

n_digits = 9
m_digits = 8

# 9! / (9-8)!
num_rearrangements = math.factorial(n_digits) / math.factorial(n_digits - m_digits)

### Response: Question: A 20-sided die is rolled.  What is the probability that a 12 or 13 is rolled?  (20-sided dice are used in some role-playing games and are numbered 0-9 twice and 11-20 once.)  Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
# the probability of an event is the number of ways the event can occur divided by the total number of outcomes
# in this case, the total number of outcomes is 20 (one for each side of the die)
# the number of ways the event (rolling a 12 or 13) can occur is 2 (one for each of the two numbers)

probability = 2 / 20

### Response: Question: 

A pond has 400 tadpoles. 1/5 of the tadpoles will grow into toads. 1/4 of the toads will be eaten by a heron. 1/6 of the tadpoles will be eaten by a newt. 1/3 of the tadpoles will mature into frogs. How many tadpoles will mature into frogs?

Solution:

# total tadpoles
tadpoles = 400

# tadpoles that will grow into toads
toads = tadpoles / 5

# toads that will be eaten by a heron
heron_toads = toads / 4

# tadpoles that will be eaten by a newt
newt_tadpoles = tadpoles / 6

# tadpoles that will mature into frogs
frogs = tadpoles / 3

# tadpoles that will mature into frogs and are not eaten
