### Response: Question: 23456789 is a 9-digit number. How many 8-digit numbers can be formed by rearranging the 9 digits of 23456789? Solution:

# 23456789 is a 9-digit number.
# The number of 8-digit numbers that can be formed by rearranging the 9 digits is 9! / (9-8)!

# 9! is the factorial of 9, which is 9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1
# (9-8)! is the factorial of 9-8, which is 1

# So, we can calculate 9! / (9-8)! as:

n_digits = 9
m_digits = 8

# 9! / (9-8)!
num_rearrangements = math.factorial(n_digits) / math.factorial(n_digits - m_digits)

### Response: Question: A 20-sided die is rolled.  What is the probability that a 12 or 13 is rolled?  (20-sided dice are used in some role-playing games and are numbered 0-9 twice and 11-20 once.)  Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
# the probability of an event is the number of ways the event can occur divided by the total number of outcomes
# in this case, the total number of outcomes is 20 (one for each side of the die)
# the number of ways the event (rolling a 12 or 13) can occur is 2 (one for each of the two numbers)

probability = 2 / 20

### Response: Question: 

A pond has 400 tadpoles. 1/5 of the tadpoles will grow into toads. 1/4 of the toads will be eaten by a heron. 1/6 of the tadpoles will be eaten by a newt. 1/3 of the tadpoles will mature into frogs. How many tadpoles will mature into frogs?

Solution:

### Response: Question: A 30-sided die has 30 sides, numbered 1 to 30. 20 of the sides are blue and 10 of the sides are red.  If the die is rolled, what is the probability that the number on the top of the die will be a multiple of 3 and the side will be blue?  (Express your answer as a common fraction.) Solution:

### The number of ways the event can occur is 20 (number of blue sides) * 10 (number of sides with a multiple of 3) = 200.
### The total number of possible outcomes is 30 (number of sides on the die).
### The probability is the number of ways the event can occur divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

def solution():
    # number of blue sides
    blue_sides = 20

### Response: Question: A 20-sided die is rolled 10 times. 

What is the probability that the number 12 is rolled at least 4 times?

The probability of rolling a 12 is 1/20. 

The probability of NOT rolling a 12 is 19/20. 

The probability of rolling a 12 at least 4 times in 10 rolls is (1/20)^4 * (19/20)^6. 

Solution: def solution():
    # The probability of rolling a 12 is 1/20
    prob_12 = 1/20
    # The probability of NOT rolling a 12 is 19/20

### Response: Question: 4567890 is a 7-digit number. 
How many 7-digit numbers are there in which the first and last digits are the same? Solution: def solution():
    #The first and last digits are the same, so there are 10 choices for the first and last digit.
    #For the 5 middle digits, there are 9 choices for the first one (any number but 0) and 8 for each of the others (any number).
    #So, the total number of 7-digit numbers is 10*9*8*8*8.

    #First and last digit have 10 choices
    first_last_digit_choices = 10
    #The 5 middle digits have 9 choices for the first one and 8 for each of the others
    middle_digits_choices = 9*8*8*8
    #The total number of 7-digit numbers is
    total_7_digit_numbers = first_last_digit_choices * middle_digits_choices

### Response: Question: 1234567890 is a 10-digit number. 
How many of the 10-digit numbers that are formed by rearranging the digits of 1234567890 are divisible by 9? Solution: 

# A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
# 1234567890 has 9 digits, so there are 9! (9 factorial) ways to rearrange them.

# The sum of the digits of 1234567890 is 54. 
# If a number is divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. 
# 54 is not divisible by 9, so no 10-digit number formed by rearranging the digits of 1234567890 is divisible by 9.

# The answer is 0.

### Response: Question: A 20-sided die is rolled. 

- What is the probability that the number rolled is a 1?
- What is the probability that the number rolled is a 20?
- What is the probability that the number rolled is a 1, 2, or 3?
- What is the probability that the number rolled is a 19 or 20?

Solution:
