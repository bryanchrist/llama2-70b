Topic: Batman ### Response: Question: The Batmobile can go 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds.  How long, in seconds, does it take to go from 60 to 0 miles per hour?

Solution:

# The Batmobile's acceleration is 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds
# This means that in 1 second, it can go from 0 to (60/3.5) mph
# To go from 60 to 0 mph, it needs to decelerate at the same rate
# So, in 1 second, it can go from 60 to (60 - (60/3.5)) mph
# To go from 60 to 0 mph, it needs (60 - (60/3.5)) seconds

def solution():
    # define the acceleration and deceleration in mph per second
    acceleration = 60 / 3.5
    deceleration = -acceleration

    # calculate the time to go from 60 to 0 mph
