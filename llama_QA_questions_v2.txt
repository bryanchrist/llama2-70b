Solution:

# The Batmobile's acceleration is 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds
# This means that in 1 second, it can go from 0 to (60/3.5) mph
# To go from 60 to 0 mph, it needs to decelerate at the same rate
# So, in 1 second, it can go from 60 to (60 - (60/3.5)) mph
# To go from 60 to 0 mph, it needs (60 - (60/3.5)) seconds

def solution():
    # define the acceleration and deceleration in mph per second

Topic: Thor ### Response: Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, can hurl his hammer 1000 miles.  If he hurls his hammer at a 45-degree angle, how far will his hammer travel before it hits the ground? (Hint: The Pythagorean Theorem will be helpful.)

Solution:
import math

#Thor can hurl his hammer 1000 miles
hammer_hurl_distance = 1000

#The hammer is hurled at a 45-degree angle
angle = 45

#Sin(45) = 0.7071
sin_angle = math.sin(math.radians(angle))

#The Pythagorean Theorem is a^2 + b^2 = c^2
#In this case, a is the horizontal distance the hammer travels and b is the vertical distance the hammer travels
#c is the total distance the hammer travels

#a = c / b
horizontal_distance = hammer_hurl_distance / sin_angle

Topic: Thor ### Response: Question: Thor, the God of Thunder, is a powerful deity.  He can hurl his hammer, Mjolnir, at 1000 miles per hour.  If he hurls it at that speed, how long, in seconds, does it take to travel 1000 miles? (Hint: the answer is not 1000.  Thor's hammer does not travel in a straight line.  It follows a parabolic trajectory.)
