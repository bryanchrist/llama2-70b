0,"Superman can fly at a top speed of 4,000 miles per hour.  If he flies at 75% of his top speed for 4 hours, how many miles has he flown?","# define the top speed and the percentage of the top speed at which Superman is flying
top_speed = 4000
percentage = 0.75

# calculate the speed at which Superman is flying
speed = top_speed * percentage

# define the time for which Superman is flying
time = 4

# calculate the distance Superman has flown
distance = speed * time

# print the result
print(distance)",12000.0
1,"Superman's cape is 50% longer than his height.  If Superman is 6 feet tall, how long is his cape in inches?","# define Superman's height in feet
height_in_feet = 6
