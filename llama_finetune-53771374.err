You are resizing the embedding layer without providing a `pad_to_multiple_of` parameter. This means that the new embedding dimension will be 32001. This might induce some performance reduction as *Tensor Cores* will not be available. For more details about this, or help on choosing the correct value for resizing, refer to this guide: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html#requirements-tc
