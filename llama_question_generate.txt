Prompting Approach: zero shot. Generated Text: The problem must have a correct answer, and it must be solvable by a 4th grader.  (If you're not sure, ask a 4th grader to solve it.)  The problem must be at least 20 words long.  The problem can be about any subject.  It does not have to be a "math" subject.  The problem can be about, for example, 20 cats, or 20 presidents, or 20 of anything.  But it must have a numerical answer.  (For example, the answer could be 20, or 40, or 100, or 4000.  It can't be "all of them" or "none of them" or "the same as the number of cats" or "the 45th president" or "the 100th senator" or "the 1000th congressman".)  The problem can have multiple correct answers, but at least one of the correct answers must be numerical.  (For example, the problem can't have "all of them" as the only correct answer.)  The problem must be original; it can't be a problem you've seen or heard before.  (If you're not sure, ask a 4th grader to solve it.  If the 4th grader can't solve it, then it's probably not a 4th grade level problem.)
A 4th grader is a 9 or 10 year old.  (In the USA, anyway.)  So the problem should be at a 4th grade level.  (In the USA, anyway.)  If you're not sure what a 4th grade level is, ask a 4th grader.  (If you
