Question: There are 3 planes flying in the sky. The first plane is flying at 400 mph and is 600 miles away from the airport. The second plane is flying at 600 mph and is 800 miles away from the airport. The third plane is flying at 800 mph and is 1000 miles away from the airport. If all 3 planes take off at the same time, which plane will reach the airport first?
Solution:
# define the variables
plane1_speed = 400
plane1_distance = 600
plane2_speed = 600
plane2_distance = 800
plane3_speed = 800
plane3_distance = 1000

# calculate the time it takes for each plane to reach the airport
plane1_time = plane1_distance / plane1_speed
plane2_time = plane2_distance / plane2_speed

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 
Question: In Fortnite, there are 4 different types of materials that can be used to build structures. Each type of material has a different hit point value. Wood is 100, Stone is 200, Metal is 300, and Brick is 400. Each material has a different harvest time. Wood takes 1 second to harvest, Stone takes 2 seconds, Metal takes 3 seconds, and Brick takes 4 seconds. In order to build a structure, you need to harvest enough materials to reach a total of 500 hit points. How long will it take you to harvest enough materials to build a structure?
Solution:

Topic: Pokémon ### Response: 
Question: Pokémon are creatures that live in the Pokémon world. They are captured by Pokémon trainers and used to battle each other. 
Pokémon have different types (e.g. Fire, Water, Grass, etc.). Each Pokémon type has strengths and weaknesses against other types.
For example, Fire Pokémon are strong against Grass Pokémon, but weak against Water Pokémon. 

Each Pokémon has a set number of hit points (HP). If a Pokémon’s HP is reduced to 0, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived.

In the Pokémon world, trainers battle each other by sending their Pokémon into battle one at a time.

Question: Pokémon are mysterious creatures that come in all shapes and sizes. They live in forests, caves, cities, and even underwater. Some Pokémon are easy to catch, while others are more difficult. In order to catch a Pokémon, you must first weaken it in battle. Once a Pokémon's health is low enough, you can throw a Poké Ball at it to try and catch it. If you succeed, the Pokémon will be added to your team.

In this exercise, you will write a program that calculates the chance of catching a Pokémon. The chance of catching a Pokémon is determined by the type of Poké Ball used and the health of the Pokémon. The type of Poké Ball used is represented by an integer from 0 to 4. A value of 0 represents a regular Poké Ball, 1 represents a Great Ball, 2 represents an Ultra Ball, 3 represents a Master Ball, and 4 represents a Safari Ball. The health of the Pokémon is represented by an integer from 0 to 100. A value of 0 represents

Topic: pizza ### Response: 
Question: How many slices of pizza are in a 14-inch pizza?

Solution:
# the area of a circle is pi * r^2, so the area of a pizza is pi * r^2
# a pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the area of each slice is pi * r^2 / 8
# we can solve for the radius r by substituting the known area of a slice and solving for r
# the radius is therefore sqrt(pi * area / 8)
# the radius of a 14-inch pizza is therefore sqrt(pi * 14^2 / 8) = 3.98 inches
# the area of a 14-inch pizza is therefore pi * 3.98^2 = 53.11 square inches
# since a pizza is cut into 8 slices, each slice has an area of 53.11 / 8 = 6.64 square inches
# a 6-inch pizza has an area of 28.26 square inches

Topic: soccer ### Response:  Question:  A soccer team has 11 players on the field.  In the first game, 2 players were injured and unable to play in the second game.  In the second game, 3 players were injured and unable to play in the third game.  In the third game, 4 players were injured and unable to play in the fourth game.

Topic: Batman ### Response:  Question: Batman needs to get from Gotham to Metropolis as quickly as possible. He can drive at 70 mph, take the train at 90 mph, or fly at 150 mph. If Gotham is 300 miles from Metropolis, what is the difference in travel time between the slowest and fastest modes of transportation?
Solution:
# define the distances and speeds
gotham_to_metropolis = 300
car_speed = 70
train_speed = 90
plane_speed = 150

# calculate the travel time for each mode of transportation

train_time = gotham_to_metropolis / train_speed
plane_time = gotham_to_metropolis / plane_speed

# calculate the difference in travel time between the slowest and fastest modes of transportation
difference_in_travel_time = train_time - plane_time

Topic: trains ### Response:  Question: A train traveling from Chicago to New York City travels at 60 mph.  A second train traveling from New York City to Chicago travels at 50 mph.  If the distance between the two cities is 1200 miles, how much faster does the first train have to travel to arrive at the same time as the second train?
Solution:
# define the variables
distance = 1200
train_1_speed = 60
train_2_speed = 50

# calculate the time it takes for train 1 to reach Chicago
train_1_time = distance / train_1_speed

train_2_time = distance / train_2_speed

# calculate the difference in time
time_difference = train_2_time - train_1_time

# calculate the difference in speed
speed_difference = time_difference * train_1_speed

Question: You are in a minecraft world and you have 200 blocks of wood and 100 blocks of coal. You want to make 100 torches, but you need 4 wood blocks and 1 coal block for each torch. How many torches can you make?

Solution:
# define the number of blocks of wood and coal
wood = 200
coal = 100

# calculate the number of torches
torches = wood // 4

# calculate the number of coal blocks needed
coal_needed = torches * 1

# calculate the number of wood blocks needed
wood_needed = torches * 4

# calculate the number of coal blocks left
coal_left = coal - coal_needed

# calculate the number of wood blocks left
wood_left = wood - wood_needed

# print the results
print(torches)

Topic: Steph Curry ### Response: 
Question: Steph Curry has scored 100 points in his last 3 games. If he scores 10 points in his next game, how many points will he have to average in his next 2 games to reach 20 points per game?
Solution:
# calculate the total number of points Steph has scored so far
total_points = 100 + 10

# calculate the total number of games Steph has played so far
total_games = 3 + 1

# calculate the average number of points per game Steph has scored so far
average_points_per_game = total_points / total_games

# calculate the total number of points Steph needs to score to reach 20 points per game
total_points_needed = 20 * (total_games + 2)

# calculate the number of points Steph needs to average in his next 2 games
average_needed = (total_points_needed - total_points) / 2
