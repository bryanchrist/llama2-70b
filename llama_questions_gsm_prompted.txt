Question: There are 3 planes flying in the sky. The first plane is flying at 400 mph and is 600 miles away from the airport. The second plane is flying at 600 mph and is 800 miles away from the airport. The third plane is flying at 800 mph and is 1000 miles away from the airport. If all 3 planes take off at the same time, which plane will reach the airport first?
Solution:
# define the variables
plane1_speed = 400
plane1_distance = 600
plane2_speed = 600
plane2_distance = 800
plane3_speed = 800
plane3_distance = 1000

# calculate the time it takes for each plane to reach the airport
plane1_time = plane1_distance / plane1_speed
plane2_time = plane2_distance / plane2_speed

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 
Question: In Fortnite, there are 4 different types of materials that can be used to build structures. Each type of material has a different hit point value. Wood is 100, Stone is 200, Metal is 300, and Brick is 400. Each material has a different harvest time. Wood takes 1 second to harvest, Stone takes 2 seconds, Metal takes 3 seconds, and Brick takes 4 seconds. In order to build a structure, you need to harvest enough materials to reach a total of 500 hit points. How long will it take you to harvest enough materials to build a structure?
Solution:

Topic: Pokémon ### Response: 
Question: Pokémon are creatures that live in the Pokémon world. They are captured by Pokémon trainers and used to battle each other. 
Pokémon have different types (e.g. Fire, Water, Grass, etc.). Each Pokémon type has strengths and weaknesses against other types.
For example, Fire Pokémon are strong against Grass Pokémon, but weak against Water Pokémon. 

Each Pokémon has a set number of hit points (HP). If a Pokémon’s HP is reduced to 0, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived.

In the Pokémon world, trainers battle each other by sending their Pokémon into battle one at a time.

Topic: Wonder Woman ### Response: 
Question: Wonder Woman is fighting a villain who has a large number of robots.  She can destroy 5 robots per minute, but the villain is creating 4 robots per minute.  How many robots does the villain need to create in 10 minutes for Wonder Woman to be outnumbered by 20?
Solution:
# define the variables
wonder_woman_rate = 5  # robots destroyed per minute
villain_rate = 4  # robots created per minute
time = 10  # minutes

# calculate the number of robots destroyed by Wonder Woman
wonder_woman_robots = wonder_woman_rate * time

# calculate the number of robots created by the villain
villain_robots = villain_rate * time

# calculate the difference
difference = villain_robots - wonder_woman_robots

# if the difference is less than 0, set it to 0
if difference < 0:
    difference = 0

Topic: cheer leading ### Response: 
Question: A cheerleading squad has 10 members. The squad is practicing for a competition and each member needs to practice 100 cartwheels, 50 jumps, and 100 splits. If each member practices for 3 hours a day, how many days will it take for each member to complete their practice?
Solution:
# define the number of cartwheels, jumps, and splits per member
cartwheels = 100
jumps = 50
splits = 100

# define the number of hours each member practices per day
practice_hours = 3

# calculate the total number of cartwheels, jumps, and splits per member

# calculate the number of days it will take each member to complete their practice
days = total_practice / 3

# print the result
print(int(days))
