### Response: Question: A bakery sells 300 loaves of bread on a weekday. On the weekend, they sell 200 loaves of bread on Saturday and 150 loaves of bread on Sunday. How many loaves of bread does the bakery sell in a week? Solution: def solution():
    #They sell 300 loaves on a weekday
    weekday_loaves = 300
    #They sell 200 loaves on Saturday
    saturday_loaves = 200
    #They sell 150 loaves on Sunday
    sunday_loaves = 150
    #They sell 300 * 5 = <<300*5=1500>>1500 loaves on weekdays
    weekday_total = weekday_loaves * 5
    #They sell 200 + 150 = <<200+150=350>>350 loaves on the weekend
    weekend_total = saturday_loaves + sunday_loaves
    #The answer is
    result = weekday_total + weekend_total
