Topic: basketball ### Response: 
In basketball, a point is scored if the ball is inside the basket. 
Scoring a point is considered a made basket. 

The number of made baskets is divided by 2 to get a made shot total. 
A shot is either considered a made shot or a missed shot. 
There are no free throws in basketball. 
The number of made baskets and made shots is equal. 
What is the meaning of all this information? Write about basketball.
Solution: A basket is what basketball is made for. Baskets can be scored. If the basket is inside the basket, then the basket can be counted towards the number of points. A shot is made if the basket is inside the basket. If then the ball does not end up in the basket, then it is considered a missed shot. There are no free throws, and making points does not increase the score. All things mentioned in this paragraph are from the question.

Topic: swimming ### Response: 
### This word problem relates to swimming as well as to the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
I'm a professional swimmer and our competition course is a 50-meter pool. For each event my coach tells me how many strokes I should be swimming each length. On the first length, I should be swimming about 25 strokes. On the second length, I should swim about 50 strokes. On the last length, I should swim 2 strokes less than I did on the second length. So, all together, I should swim 79 strokes during the race. However, there is a problem. I have a cramp! I only swim 2 strokes on each length because I'm in so much pain. If I still swam all 3 lengths, I would still have 2 strokes left, which I would be saving for the start of my next race. What is the total number of strokes I have swum?

Topic: planes ### Response:  A plane flew into the wind 720 miles in 5 hours. The return trip against the wind required 6 hours. What was the plane speed in mph? (Note: The wind speed remains unchanged throughout the question.)
Solution:

def solution():
    ## The 720 is from going with +, and 5 is the time.  It'll always be (value)(time) = total
    ## so we're dividing 720 by 5 to get (velocity + wind)* 5 = 720
    ## wind is subtracted, so its opposite.  Therefore, we're adding the plane speed and the wind speed.
    ## the time is going to stay the same since we are going to wind in the same time, so the number
    ## we're going to divide into wind will be the velocity.  So in 5 hours they're going (v + w)*5, or
    ## v*5 + w*5 = 720
    planespeed = 720/5 - wind
    ## now we're doing the return

To my understanding, for some vectors in a given vector space $V$, $e_1,...,e_n$, if they satisfy:


1. They are linearly independent.
2. Their linear combinations span $V$.


Then they form a basis for $V$.

Topic: trains ### Response:  There were 270 wagons on train A. There were 360 wagons on train B. There were 125 more wagons on train A than train B. They were all traveling in different directions, so they met at the train station to compare their wagon counts. How many wagons were on each train?
Solution:
def solution():
    #We started with 270 wagons on train A
    train_a = 270
    #We know that there were 360 wagons on train B

May 27, 2018


Refer to the explanation.

#### Explanation:

Graph:

$y = - \frac{3}{2} x - 1$


The equation is in slope-intercept form, $y = m x + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.


In this problem, the slope of the line is $- \frac{3}{2}$ and the y-intercept's coordinate is $\left(0 , - 1\right)$.


Plot the point $\left(0 , - 1\right)$, then use the slope to locate another point.


The slope is $- \frac{3}{2}$, and from the first point rise 3 and run 2 (since the whole number 2 is in the denominator

I have a list, l, of n integers of length,

I have to loop through the list and do some task when ever there is a jump of greater than 1 between two consecutive numbers(l[i] > l[i-1]+1). Also there must be 2 consecutive jumps ( l[i] > l[i-1]+1 AND l[i+1] > l[i]+1 ).


If, there is a gap of k >2 between two consecutive numbers( l[i+k] > l[i+1]+2 AND l[i+j] > l[i+j-1]+1 ), then I should skip doing the task for the pair l[i] and l[i+j] and do it for a pair later like l[i+1] and l[i+j+1].

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 
Patrick Mahomes 19 passes. 
Patrick has 10 completed passes. 
How many completions did his first receiver have?
### A few notes about your response:
- Use the first name only, no middle or last name.
- First sentence should begin with the response to the question (e.g. "His first receiver had..." or "The first receiver had...").
- Response should be a sentence or similar sentence structure (question mark or period, but no exclamation points unless it makes sense).
- Do not add extra information not in the prompt. It is not necessary and it reduces the ability to solve the word problems.
- Answer should be numerical and correct unit (e.g. "20 miles/hour" but not "20").
- Always indent Python code 4 spaces so that it will format correctly on Gradescope (the line below is just here to display the correct indentation on the blog).

### Construct a polynomial function from a table


The problem asks you to predict what a polynomial in the given order looks like. It's good review, and you should learn to do this when reviewing for tests. # Which is better for a pump, high flow or high head?


I have a pump which pumps from 0m above sea level to 12m above sea level. If it can pump at 300 litres per minute and 3600 litres per minute will this increase the efficiency of the pump? I read an article on wikipedia that say's "to increase efficiency then you need to add more head" (to quote approximately). Does this therefore mean that a pump with 300 l/m will be more efficient than a pump with 3600l/m?

This question is really out of place. A question about basketball should not reference soccer and football.

Topic: Super Mario ### Response: 
Question: Super Mario ate 50 coins during his last level. His brother, Luigi, ate 10 coins. How many coins did they eat in total?
  
Solution: In this Python function, we calculate Super Mario and Luigi's total number of coins by adding the two numbers of coins eaten. 
We can calculate it this way because they independently eat coins, which means that they have eaten the number of coins they did independently, so we can just add. 

The total number of coins they ate is 60, which we get by adding the number of coins Mario and Luigi ate, which is 50 and 10, respectively. 
The result is 50+10 = 60. 
def solution():
    #Number of coins Super Mario ate in his last level
    mario_coins = 50
    #Number of coins Luigi ate in his last level
    luigi_coins = 10
    #total number of coins

Topic: Superman ### Response: 1. Answer 1: Superman can fly 100 miiles per hour. How long does it take Superman to fly 10. miles? Superman flies 100 miles per hour. This means that Superman can cover a distance of 100 miles in 1 hour. We can use this information to determine how long it takes Superman to fly 10 miles. We know that 100 miles in 1 hour, so it takes Superman 0.1 hours to fly 10 miles. The answer is 0.1 hours.
def solution1():
    #Superman can fly 100 miles per hour
    speed = 100
    #Let's say he flies for .01 hours
    mins = 0.01
    #100 * 0.01 = 1 mile
    mile = speed * mins
    assert mile == 1

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 
### Question:
Patrick Mahomes throws a ball to a fellow teammate. 

The ball was in the air for 2.70 seconds. 
It travelled a height of 100 feet. 
How far did the ball travel horizontally?

### Solution:
#Patrick Mahomes threw a ball to a teammate.
#The ball was in the air for 2.70 seconds.
#It travelled a height of 100 feet.
#We can use the formula h = 1/2 * g * t² to determine the distance horizontally that the ball traveled
#Vertical distance = 100 feet (given)
#Vertical acceleration = 16 ft/s^2 (gravity)
#Horizontal velocity = ? feet per seconds
#Horizontal acceleration = 0 (no acceleration horizontally)
#Time in air = 2.70 seconds (given)
#The question is about the horizontal distance of the ball, so we need to calculate only horizontal velocities (horizontal velocity = x/t)
#Horizontal velocity

Topic: LeBron James ### Response:  LeBron James is 23 years old. LeBron is x years younger than Michael Jordan. When LeBron is the same age as Michael Jordan, his age will be what?` This is the first post in notes on my reading of John Kelly's book The Process of Education. The next post is here.


Last time I wrote about the tension between how teachers should "allow the children to play, and let them take the initiative in their play" (p. 197) and the reality that even if you let them play, they usually won't.


And the first question I would suggest you ask in answer to this state of things is not "Why do not the children take the initiative in their play?" but rather "How comes it that adults can be got to take the initiative in their teaching?" When we meet with resistance to the view of our duty, we can hardly do better than boldly attack it frontally, and ask ourselves at what precise points our courage fails us and why, and where, and whither.(p. 200)


So, what's the source of the resistance?

Question: Minecraft has a command setblock that sets the block id, meta, and data at a coordinates in Minecraft. The coordinates are block_x, block_y, and block_z. The id, meta, and data parameters are all positive integers. 

The command looks like setblock 10 40 100 2 4 6 The parameters can be put on separate lines in Minecraft and each line is considered a seperate command. If you wanted a glass in Minecraft at block coordinates x=10 y=40 z=100, would you need 1 or 2 commands?

Between 0.5 and 1.5 is "half-way" in the sense of being the "middle value", or the first of two equally distant quantities that divide a quantity into two equal parts. For example, between 0.5 and 1.5, if a quantity is divided in two equal parts, either part would be 0.5. The half sums up the word "half": in a set of n things, half is n/2. It is the sum of a cardinal and an ordinal number: 1 + 2 = (3-1) = 2.

    """
    The Power Rangers are battling the Space Wacky Force. One punch by them will take out a single monster. One punch by the Space Wacky force will take out three Power Rangers. If they fight three rounds, how many Power Rangers will remain standing?
    """ In a previous blog post I showed how to use a technique called ‘sliced inverse regression’ to find out which variables in a dataset are most relevant to a particular response variable. This technique works by running a linear model on slices of data, and averaging the parameters over those slices.


This idea was originally proposed for use as a general method for analysing high-dimensional data, such as the data sets commonly found in biology and medical research with lots of predictor variables and few samples.


However, I think that sliced inverse regression (SIR) is actually useful in another area – data exploration
