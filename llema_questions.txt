Topic: basketball ### Response: 
In basketball, a point is scored if the ball is inside the basket. 
Scoring a point is considered a made basket. 

The number of made baskets is divided by 2 to get a made shot total. 
A shot is either considered a made shot or a missed shot. 
There are no free throws in basketball. 
The number of made baskets and made shots is equal. 
What is the meaning of all this information? Write about basketball.
Solution: A basket is what basketball is made for. Baskets can be scored. If the basket is inside the basket, then the basket can be counted towards the number of points. A shot is made if the basket is inside the basket. If then the ball does not end up in the basket, then it is considered a missed shot. There are no free throws, and making points does not increase the score. All things mentioned in this paragraph are from the question.

Topic: swimming ### Response: 
### This word problem relates to swimming as well as to the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2)
I'm a professional swimmer and our competition course is a 50-meter pool. For each event my coach tells me how many strokes I should be swimming each length. On the first length, I should be swimming about 25 strokes. On the second length, I should swim about 50 strokes. On the last length, I should swim 2 strokes less than I did on the second length. So, all together, I should swim 79 strokes during the race. However, there is a problem. I have a cramp! I only swim 2 strokes on each length because I'm in so much pain. If I still swam all 3 lengths, I would still have 2 strokes left, which I would be saving for the start of my next race. What is the total number of strokes I have swum?

Topic: planes ### Response:  A plane flew into the wind 720 miles in 5 hours. The return trip against the wind required 6 hours. What was the plane speed in mph? (Note: The wind speed remains unchanged throughout the question.)
Solution:

def solution():
    ## The 720 is from going with +, and 5 is the time.  It'll always be (value)(time) = total
    ## so we're dividing 720 by 5 to get (velocity + wind)* 5 = 720
    ## wind is subtracted, so its opposite.  Therefore, we're adding the plane speed and the wind speed.
    ## the time is going to stay the same since we are going to wind in the same time, so the number
    ## we're going to divide into wind will be the velocity.  So in 5 hours they're going (v + w)*5, or
    ## v*5 + w*5 = 720
    planespeed = 720/5 - wind
    ## now we're doing the return

To my understanding, for some vectors in a given vector space $V$, $e_1,...,e_n$, if they satisfy:


1. They are linearly independent.
2. Their linear combinations span $V$.


Then they form a basis for $V$.

Topic: trains ### Response:  There were 270 wagons on train A. There were 360 wagons on train B. There were 125 more wagons on train A than train B. They were all traveling in different directions, so they met at the train station to compare their wagon counts. How many wagons were on each train?
Solution:
def solution():
    #We started with 270 wagons on train A
    train_a = 270
    #We know that there were 360 wagons on train B

May 27, 2018


Refer to the explanation.

#### Explanation:

Graph:

$y = - \frac{3}{2} x - 1$


The equation is in slope-intercept form, $y = m x + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.


In this problem, the slope of the line is $- \frac{3}{2}$ and the y-intercept's coordinate is $\left(0 , - 1\right)$.


Plot the point $\left(0 , - 1\right)$, then use the slope to locate another point.


The slope is $- \frac{3}{2}$, and from the first point rise 3 and run 2 (since the whole number 2 is in the denominator

I have a list, l, of n integers of length,

I have to loop through the list and do some task when ever there is a jump of greater than 1 between two consecutive numbers(l[i] > l[i-1]+1). Also there must be 2 consecutive jumps ( l[i] > l[i-1]+1 AND l[i+1] > l[i]+1 ).


If, there is a gap of k >2 between two consecutive numbers( l[i+k] > l[i+1]+2 AND l[i+j] > l[i+j-1]+1 ), then I should skip doing the task for the pair l[i] and l[i+j] and do it for a pair later like l[i+1] and l[i+j+1].

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 
Patrick Mahomes 19 passes. 
Patrick has 10 completed passes. 
How many completions did his first receiver have?
### A few notes about your response:
- Use the first name only, no middle or last name.
- First sentence should begin with the response to the question (e.g. "His first receiver had..." or "The first receiver had...").
- Response should be a sentence or similar sentence structure (question mark or period, but no exclamation points unless it makes sense).
- Do not add extra information not in the prompt. It is not necessary and it reduces the ability to solve the word problems.
- Answer should be numerical and correct unit (e.g. "20 miles/hour" but not "20").
- Always indent Python code 4 spaces so that it will format correctly on Gradescope (the line below is just here to display the correct indentation on the blog).

### Construct a polynomial function from a table


The problem asks you to predict what a polynomial in the given order looks like. It's good review, and you should learn to do this when reviewing for tests. # Which is better for a pump, high flow or high head?


I have a pump which pumps from 0m above sea level to 12m above sea level. If it can pump at 300 litres per minute and 3600 litres per minute will this increase the efficiency of the pump? I read an article on wikipedia that say's "to increase efficiency then you need to add more head" (to quote approximately). Does this therefore mean that a pump with 300 l/m will be more efficient than a pump with 3600l/m?

This question is really out of place. A question about basketball should not reference soccer and football.

Topic: Super Mario ### Response: 
Question: Super Mario ate 50 coins during his last level. His brother, Luigi, ate 10 coins. How many coins did they eat in total?
  
Solution: In this Python function, we calculate Super Mario and Luigi's total number of coins by adding the two numbers of coins eaten. 
We can calculate it this way because they independently eat coins, which means that they have eaten the number of coins they did independently, so we can just add. 

The total number of coins they ate is 60, which we get by adding the number of coins Mario and Luigi ate, which is 50 and 10, respectively. 
The result is 50+10 = 60. 
def solution():
    #Number of coins Super Mario ate in his last level
    mario_coins = 50
    #Number of coins Luigi ate in his last level
    luigi_coins = 10
    #total number of coins

Topic: Superman ### Response: 1. Answer 1: Superman can fly 100 miiles per hour. How long does it take Superman to fly 10. miles? Superman flies 100 miles per hour. This means that Superman can cover a distance of 100 miles in 1 hour. We can use this information to determine how long it takes Superman to fly 10 miles. We know that 100 miles in 1 hour, so it takes Superman 0.1 hours to fly 10 miles. The answer is 0.1 hours.
def solution1():
    #Superman can fly 100 miles per hour
    speed = 100
    #Let's say he flies for .01 hours
    mins = 0.01
    #100 * 0.01 = 1 mile
    mile = speed * mins
    assert mile == 1

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 
### Question:
Patrick Mahomes throws a ball to a fellow teammate. 

The ball was in the air for 2.70 seconds. 
It travelled a height of 100 feet. 
How far did the ball travel horizontally?

### Solution:
#Patrick Mahomes threw a ball to a teammate.
#The ball was in the air for 2.70 seconds.
#It travelled a height of 100 feet.
#We can use the formula h = 1/2 * g * t² to determine the distance horizontally that the ball traveled
#Vertical distance = 100 feet (given)
#Vertical acceleration = 16 ft/s^2 (gravity)
#Horizontal velocity = ? feet per seconds
#Horizontal acceleration = 0 (no acceleration horizontally)
#Time in air = 2.70 seconds (given)
#The question is about the horizontal distance of the ball, so we need to calculate only horizontal velocities (horizontal velocity = x/t)
#Horizontal velocity

Topic: LeBron James ### Response:  LeBron James is 23 years old. LeBron is x years younger than Michael Jordan. When LeBron is the same age as Michael Jordan, his age will be what?` This is the first post in notes on my reading of John Kelly's book The Process of Education. The next post is here.


Last time I wrote about the tension between how teachers should "allow the children to play, and let them take the initiative in their play" (p. 197) and the reality that even if you let them play, they usually won't.


And the first question I would suggest you ask in answer to this state of things is not "Why do not the children take the initiative in their play?" but rather "How comes it that adults can be got to take the initiative in their teaching?" When we meet with resistance to the view of our duty, we can hardly do better than boldly attack it frontally, and ask ourselves at what precise points our courage fails us and why, and where, and whither.(p. 200)


So, what's the source of the resistance?

Question: Minecraft has a command setblock that sets the block id, meta, and data at a coordinates in Minecraft. The coordinates are block_x, block_y, and block_z. The id, meta, and data parameters are all positive integers. 

The command looks like setblock 10 40 100 2 4 6 The parameters can be put on separate lines in Minecraft and each line is considered a seperate command. If you wanted a glass in Minecraft at block coordinates x=10 y=40 z=100, would you need 1 or 2 commands?

Between 0.5 and 1.5 is "half-way" in the sense of being the "middle value", or the first of two equally distant quantities that divide a quantity into two equal parts. For example, between 0.5 and 1.5, if a quantity is divided in two equal parts, either part would be 0.5. The half sums up the word "half": in a set of n things, half is n/2. It is the sum of a cardinal and an ordinal number: 1 + 2 = (3-1) = 2.

This technique works by running a linear model on slices of data, and averaging the parameters over those slices.

However, I think that sliced inverse regression (SIR) is actually useful in another area – data exploration

Floating point constants (that is, a real number) are stored in hardware with a bounded precision. This precision is also bound to the programming language you use, and thus, your programs should consider this bounded precision, even though it can appear that the programming language is able to display “infinite” precision (which is false).


This blog post will dive a little deeper into the precision of floating numbers. This is important, because when you think your number will map identically to your monitor,

Topic: cats ### Response:  ## Existence and global stability of uniformly persistent periodic solutions of a general population model.(English)Zbl 0599.92018


A general nonlinear population model of the form $$\dot x=f(x,t)$$, satisfying certain conditions, is considered. Under such a circumstance the authors prove the existence of a family of globally asymptotically stable periodic solutions. In such way, this article is a continuation of [the second author, ibid., 91-110 (1983; Zbl 0523.92011): Existence and uniqueness of a positive periodic solution for a nonlinear model of a food-ltd. population. In the first part of the paper the authors derive certain sufficient conditions for the existence of a strictly positive unique periodic solution for the model $$\dot x=x(a-bx)$$, $$b>0$$. In the second part the authors study a global asymptotic stability of the periodic solutions.

Topic: Captain America ### Response: 
There is another way to have Captain America fight the Mandarin. The answer to the puzzle isn't wrong, but it's not the only answer. Here's a step-by-step solution to the puzzle. It's not really about Captain America though.
1. What's the average weight of the 3 heroes? (120lbs)(150lbs)(600lbs) (120+150+600)/3 = 330 So the average weight is 330lbs.
2. Captain America's weight is 4 times the average weight. If we multiply 330lbs by 4, we get 1320lbs, the weight of Captain America.
3. We have 3 equations: 120 + 150 + 600 = 870 Captain America's weight is 4x times the average weight. That means that 870 + captain america's weight = 4x. So our third equation is 870 + 1320 = 4x

Topic: cars ### Response:  # How and why does it work? A very basic circuit question


I am new to electronics, and I can't seem to get a grip on this basic thing. My question is how do we know what resistance we need if we want to create a circuit that converts a water pump to a pressure regulated faucet? And I also don't get how ohms law works, which I know I need to understand this basic question.


• Can you clarify your "water pump to a pressure regulated faucet"? That doesn't make sense out of context (I haven't seen/used one, so I can't figure it out). – Bort Mar 25 '18 at 15:22
• I want to know how to design a circuit that gets voltage from a water pump and adjusts its flow rate according to a potentiometer. I know how to calculate resistance values that will drop voltage so that it wouldnt fry the potentiometer, but I don't know how to make this circuit work, and I don't know how to calculate its resistances according to its intended function.

### Goal

We’ll learn how to predict and explain classifications and regressions from a large number of features in a Sparse Machine Learning model. We’ll also learn how to re-train or fine-tune that model to improve performance.


### Background

The H2O library supports MOJO scoring for Sparse data which includes most features encountered in genomics applications. This MOJO support is intended for datasets where:


• the number of features is very large,
• many of the input features are expected to be missing.

These considerations motivate a sparse data representation of the input data. The MOJO scoring operation on H2O will also be faster if you use sparse inputs, even if you use dense data in the training.

Give me a word problem about ice cream and a Python function that will solve the word problem.  Make the response creative!  Include comments to explain the code.
### Solution: 
A customer who's ordering ice cream from Chase Creamery would like to know how many gallons of Vanilla he can get in his order that will cost him no more than $20.  In an effort to figure that out, we decided to find the cost of a gallon of Vanilla ice cream at Chase Creamery.  Next, we divided the maximum price that the customer is willing to pay ($20) by the amount of $1 a customer pays per gallon of Vanilla ice cream.  This number, which is the variable "result" in Python, yields the maximum number of gallons of Vanilla ice cream that the user can buy for no more than$20.
#Given: the customer wants to know how many gallons he can get for a cost of no more than $20  #Find out the cost of a gallon of ice cream at Chase  vanilla_price = 1

# Deep Neural Nets from First Principles in Python


As part of my ‘Renewable Energy’ Course assignment, I had to implement a Deep Neural Network from scratch. I thought it will be a good idea not to use any Deep Learing Library but to rewrite my Neural Net from scratch. It was quite a challenge for a beginner in Python (somehow I managed to do the assignment with the help of Course TAs).

Problem: Someone goes on a mining expedition to find coal.

They find an underground coal deposit.

They've made a nice 10x10x10 structure of coal and now need to get the coal blocks home.

They have a chest of 27 slots each holding 64 coal, giving a total of 27x64=1728 coal blocks. 1728 will make a stack that is 1 wide, 3 high, and 16 blocks deep.

This could make for 10 stacks of coal in the chest, as the structure was 10x10.

10 stacks of coal should be 160 blocks deep into the chest. 
The chest goes two slots deep in the walls of the crafting table.
Now, the person starts mining coal in a 3x3x3 grid (9 blocks) to fill the chest to full capacity.

Topic: cookies ### Response: 20 boys ate 5 cookies. How many cookies did 10 children eat? The answer should be 5 because there are 10 boys, not 10 children.
I used to bake cookies for my grandchild and I always had to guess how many cookies to bake.
I would just guess 250 cookies. The kids would get in a line and each of them was allowed to eat one cookie.  Then, they walked through the line one more time, the teacher went through and removed a cookie from each kid's plate that was a cat cookie.
If there were 250 cat cookies, it was enough for the teachers and kids. If not, then I
would bake another 250 cookies.  We did this for many years so I came away with the rule of 250 cookies per batch.

    #There are 20 boys and they each ate 5 cookies

Solution:
The time I did something brave / bold / difficult was during the field hockey field hockey game earlier this season at 950am. 
It was in my first game of the season, 
I was nervous to be on the field, 
but my coach told me that I would do well 
and that we would work together to make sure 
I stayed safe and was not called out for being too aggressive. 
Since I played on defense in the game, 
I was called in as the second defender every time a score was made on my team. 
During the first 20 minutes of play, I was called in for 3 different plays. 
I didn't really know what I was supposed to do on defense, so the first 2 times I was called in, I just followed the first defender. 
After the first play, I noticed that he was leaving me to chase the ball while he waited, so I took the ball and walked backwards a couple of yards,

Write an expression about your favorite video game character. # What is the relation of the determinants of two related matrices?

Suppose you have a matrix $A_{nm}$, which is the result of matrix multiplication of the matrices $A_{k\times l}$ and $B_{l \times m}$. (For simplicity, let me set $k = l$.)


I am wondering if there is a general expression for Det$[A]$ in terms of Det$[B]$ and Det$[C]$, i.e. the determinants of the input matrices. Or, it might be the case that it depends on the structure of $A,B,C$.


I think I can only find special cases where this is possible. For example, if one of the matrices is diagonal, or if they all have determinant one, the multiplication is just scaling by some number, therefore the determinant of the product will be the product of the determinants.

In general, you can't say anything, but it's known that, for a fixed matrix $B$, the map sending $C$ to $\det(

Topic: volleyball ### Response: 

#Volleyball is a sport that requires a lot of training to be good at. To become a better player, it's important to watch other people play and to practice what you see yourself. Volleyball is a very competitive sport, and you have to be ready to play every moment of every game.

#Players typically train and practice every day to try to hone their skills, and if they want to play on a team, they have to try out. Teams usually have an assistant coach who also trains and practices with the team. A team could have as many as fifteen players, plus the assistant coach and sometimes one of the players' parents.
#Along with practices and games, the players also have to study their sports, which means they have to spend a lot of time reading about the game and practicing how to do various skills.
#Players get a high school letter in volleyball, or a varsity letter, if they belong to the school team and play in at least five matches during the year. They can earn more letters and get honors if they do well in tournaments or in dual matches.

Topic: dinosaurs ### Response: 
The first line starts with the question "What is it, and why is it interesting?" This line is important since it tells the professor the kind of paper I will write.
In my paper I will write about a dinosaur called Tyrannosaurus Rex. The reason I chose this dinosaur was because this dinosaur has fascinated me for a long time. I first learned about this dinosaur when I was around 8 or 9 years old. Since then, I have always wanted to learn more about what this dinosaur looked like, how it evolved, what it ate, how fast it could run, and how it related to humans today.
I first heard about this dinosaur from a book called "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, aged 13 3/4," by Sue Townsend. This book was read to me by a relative when I was young. At the time, the story seemed very strange and even scary at times.

I’m back! This month I’ll look at “The Expected Utility Theorem” in depth.


So, why did Von Neumann and Morgenstern name their theorem “The Expected Utility Theorem”? It isn’t because of the role of the expected value, or even of the utility function. It is because of its implications about the choices we make.


To understand this, consider a coin toss. You can either bet on heads and win $H if it is true, or on tails and win$T if it is true. To decide which choice is rational one must look at not just how much you can win… but how likely you are to win it. And so we make a choice out of a set of probabilities (that you are correct) multiplied by payoffs (the utility you get for each different circumstance):


$U=P(H)\cdot{U(H)}+P(T)\cdot{U(T)}$

def solution(): # ¶ Randomness


In computer science, a pseudorandom number generator (prng) is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers, but is entirely deterministic.


A PRNG starts from an arbitrary starting state using a seed state. It then uses an algorithm to generate the subsequent “random” numbers. Although sequences that are closer to truly random can be generated using hardware random number generators, pseudorandom number generators are important in practice for their speed in number generation and their reproducibility.


There is an ongoing controversy over whether some commonly used PRNG algorithms and their implementations have some systematic defects that could lead to defects in the randomness of their output in certain cases. (For general software security, this is less important than the possibility of defects in the use of the algorithms – see:

Topic: field hockey ### Response: 
There are 27 players on a hockey team. The team has 6 forwards, 6 midfielders, and 15 defenders. What is the best way to arrange 27 hockey players into roles?
We are going to arrange this group of 27 players on the hockey team into roles. Let’s represent each type of player with their corresponding letter. The 6 defenders are represented by A, B, C, D, E, and F. The 6 midfielders are represented by G, H, I, J, K, and L. The 6 defenders are represented by A, B, C, D, E, and F. And 6 forwards are represented by M, N, O, P, Q, and R. The question is, What is the best way to arrange 27 hockey players into roles?
From a quick glance at the arrangement of 27 players, it seems like a brute force technique could work. But a more thorough analysis will reveal the optimal placement of players based on the structure of the problem.

You may reuse a previous solution for this task. If you decide to reuse a previous solution, indicate in your response where in the code you would adjust for your favorite word problem. For instance, if the word problem was about Pokémon, then in the code you may replace a variable name like "volts" with the variable name of "pokemon". These two variable names would do the same thing in the code, so you just need to rename the commented out step-by-step solution's variable names

Topic: lacrosse ### Response:  A new technique for the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{100}Mo$.(English)Zbl 1235.81194


Summary: We developed a new technique for the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay ($2\beta ^{2nd}(0\nu ))$. This technique uses low-noise cryogenic light detectors in order to measure Cherenkov light emitted from the liquid scintillator surrounding the $$^{100}Mo$$ absorber. The Cherenkov light signal gives us an ability to reduce the natural background of the $$2\beta ^{2nd}(0\nu )$$ event by approximately 10 times. We can further reduce the background by 5 times with the aid of several light detectors. The new technique has low mass, as a result of a compact configuration of the light-detector system that allows it to be integrated into the $$2\beta ^{2nd}(0\nu )$$ detector. This new technique of detecting of light is important for future searches for $$2\beta ^{2nd}(0\nu )$$ of

Topic: Iron Man ### Response: 
Question: Tony Stark’s armor contains 3 different shields and 25 weapons. His 4 closest friends, War Machine, Rhodey, Pepper, and Rescue, have used up all 25 weapons. Tony wants to distribute the remaining weapons and shields evenly between the 4 friends. How many weapons and shields would each friend recieve?
Solution:
def solution():
    """
    Let "x" be the number of weapons and shields each friend would recieve
    We know that Tony's armor contains 3 different shields and 25 weapons.
    His 4 closest friends, War Machine, Rhodey, Pepper, and Rescue, have used up all 25 weapons. 
    So that leaves 3 different shields and (25 - 25) weapons, or 3 different shields and 0 weapons with Tony.
    Tony wants to distribute the 3 different shields and 0 weapons evenly between 4 friends.
    So we get the equation: x = (3 different shields + 0 weapons) ／ 4

Topic: unicorns ### Response: 7 unicorns were eating 12 carrots. 11 unicorns were eating 7 carrots. How many carrots were eaten?
In this example, the unicorns were not helpful at solving the math problem. If they had been helpful, how I would have expected them to be helpful is by first pointing out that the question could have been written as “3 unicorns were eating 5 carrots. 8 unicorns were eating 11 carrots. How many carrots were eaten?”.
Another approach would be for the unicorns to tell me 7 unicorns were eating 12 carrots and not help out with anything more since I could then use that fact to answer the question. In reality, the unicorns would never answer simple math problems because they’d all have to be in one place to answer at the same time and they don’t need to do that. So this isn’t a real scenario where the unicorns would be helpful. They’re just pretending to be helpful by giving me correct information

Topic: football ### Response: 0: You have an idea that you want to test. Let's say you think that the Seattle Seahawks would beat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl this season. But you are not totally sure. You say to yourself: "I need to find out what the expected point differential between these two teams is from data. " You remember from your sports analytics class from last semester that you need to find the points scored for each team per game and compare them to determine this point differential with a null hypothesis and p value. You download a file from a website with all the past games between these two teams. You decide to analyze the game data from the 2017 NFL year to the most recent NFL year. Each dataset row has three columns: the date of the game, the scores of team 1, and the scores of team 2. Team 1 is the Seattle Seahawks and team 2 is the New England Patriots. You use a Jupyter notebook with the Pandas module and write Python code to read in this data into a DataFrame and add one column with the point differential by subtracting team 1 score from team 2 score for each game.

### Practice Problem

The amount of apples a man ate each month is plotted on the chart. Question: On average, how many apples did the man eat each month? Answer: Let's solve this word problem step by step. The sum of the apples the man ate for each month is $$5 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 9 = 25$$ So the man ate a total of 25 apples in 5 months. We can divide 25 by 5 to find the average amount of apples ate each month. $$\frac{25}{5} = 5$$ Therefore, the man ate an average of 5 apples each month.

Topic: Captain Marvel ### Response: 
### Warm Up Question: Do you think our alien friend can come up with the same equation as you? Explain your rationale.
-Avengers are all very strong, Captain Marvel can beat up the Hulk. Captain Marvel likes the Hulk because he can squish her enemies. When Captain Marvel squishes someone it adds 100 to the person's score. Everyone likes Superman. When you add to Superman's score, it adds 1000. Captain America, Spider-man, Iron Man and Thor add 50 each time someone likes them. Hulk adds 5 only when people like him and Captain Marvel adds 20 only when people like him.-When Captain Marvel, Spider-man, Iron Man and Thor are together their scores all go up by 750. That is because Captain Marvel likes them, Spider-man, Iron Man and Thor all like each other, and Superman and Captain Marvel like each other.
-The alien will probably use the same number for every team Captain Marvel makes up.

Topic: basketball ### Response: 50 students practice free throws at the school gym. The basketball team scores 80% overall, but is allowed to practice only 2 more sets before the coach cuts practice. How many of students are left that need to practice?
# We need to calculate total number of sets, then subtract sets made by team.
# Calculate total number of sets:
# 50 is the total number of students, or the total number of sets.
# Set is a unit of measure of practice.
total_number_sets = 50
# Calculate sets made by team:
# 80% of sets were made by the team. We can calculate the amount of sets made by the team:
# 80% is the same as 80 over 100, or 80 / 100.
# We need to change the numerator and denominator to whole numbers by multiplying by 100 to get whole numbers.
# After multiplying, the new expression is 8000 / 10000.
# By simplifying, we get 800 / 1000

3 kicks have a 2/5 chance to go in. 
How many kicks does it take to have a 4/9 chance that at least 1 goes in?"
#Penalty kicks usually succeed with a probability of 2/5

Abstract: We propose a Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCArT) technique for simultaneously estimating the principal components as well as their loadings. We show that rotating the data to align the principal directions of the data with the principal directions of PC loadings enables us to recover a consistent estimate of the PC loadings via a simple and efficiently-computable entrywise thresholding.

Question: 
Wonder Woman is out in the woods by herself, doing training exercises. 
Her training regimen includes bench pressing multiple 200 pound logs, running around in circles with logs stacked on her back, and breaking boards with her bare hands (she's very strong). 
Wonder Woman is in excellent physical shape, but it takes a lot of stamina to work out in the woods without water. 
Wonder Woman has three 200 pound logs she'll need to bench press. 
She wants to know how many bench press reps she can do with three 200 pound logs.
Solution:
In the above word problem, you want to create a Python function that calculates how many bench press reps Wonder Woman can do with three 200 pound logs.
Wonder Woman is an experienced weightlifter and she can do 80 bench press reps with 200 pound logs. She doesn't have any water today, so she'll only be able to do 80 reps.
