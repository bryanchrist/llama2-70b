If 5/7 of the total number of hippos give birth to 5 new baby hippos each, the total number of new hippos born is 5/7*35= <<5/7*35=25>>25
There are ten more newborn elephants than baby hippos, meaning there are 25+10=35 new baby elephants.
The entire herd starts with 20 elephants and 35 hippos, and when the new baby elephants and hippos are born, the total number of animals becomes 20+35+35+25= <<20+35+35+25=95>>95

Prompting Approach: few shot. Generated Text: ### Response: 30 minutes is 1/2 of an hour. The first spacecraft traveled 448 miles in 1/2 hour, and the second spacecraft traveled the same distance in 1 hour. Therefore, the first spacecraft traveled at twice the speed of the second spacecraft. The first spacecraft traveled at a speed of 448 miles per hour, and the second spacecraft traveled at a speed of 224 miles per hour. The difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft was 448-224=<<448-224=224>>224 miles per hour.
