Topic: basketball ### Response: 
Question: A basketball team played 40 games in the regular season. They won 28 games and lost 12 games. How many total points did they score in all 40 games?

Solution:To solve this problem, we need to find the total points scored in all 40 games. We know that they won 28 games and lost 12 games, so they played 28 + 12 = 40 games in total.

Since we don't have the individual scores for each game, we can't calculate the exact total points scored. However, we can express the total points as a function of the number of games won and lost.

Let's denote the points scored in a won game as W and the points scored in a lost game as L. Then, the total points scored in all 40 games can be represented as:

Total Points = 28W + 12L

Since we don't have the values for W and L, we can't calculate the exact total points. But this equation represents the total points scored in all 40 games.

Ice Cream Word Problem
Mary has 3 different flavors of ice cream. 
She has Vanilla (V), Chocolate (C), and Strawberry (S).
She has a total of 20 scoops of ice cream.
V + C + S = 20
She has Vanilla (V) and Chocolate (C) in equal amounts.
V = C
So we know that V + C = 20 - S
2V = 20 - S
V = 10 - (S/2)
Vanilla (V) and Chocolate (C) combined have 10 scoops of ice cream.
So, 2V + S = 20
Substituting the value of V from above,
2(10 - (S/2)) + S = 20
20 - S/2 + S = 20
20 + S/2 = 20
S/2 = 0
So, S = 0

Topic: basketball ### Response: 2 teams are playing basketball. Team A has 5 players on the court. Each player on team A can only play for 5 minutes before they need to be substituted out for a rest. Team A has 12 players total, so they can play for 12*5=<<12*5=60>>60 minutes before they run out of players to substitute in.
Team B has 6 players on the court. Each player on team B can play for 10 minutes before they need to be substituted out. Team B has 18 players total, so they can play for 18*10=<<18*10=180>>180 minutes before they run out of players to substitute in.
Team A will run out of players first, so the game will end after 60 minutes.
