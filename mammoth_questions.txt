Topic: basketball ### Response: 
Question: A basketball team played 40 games in the regular season. They won 28 games and lost 12 games. How many total points did they score in all 40 games?

Solution:To solve this problem, we need to find the total points scored in all 40 games. We know that they won 28 games and lost 12 games, so they played 28 + 12 = 40 games in total.

Since we don't have the individual scores for each game, we can't calculate the exact total points scored. However, we can express the total points as a function of the number of games won and lost.

Let's denote the points scored in a won game as W and the points scored in a lost game as L. Then, the total points scored in all 40 games can be represented as:

Total Points = 28W + 12L

Since we don't have the values for W and L, we can't calculate the exact total points. But this equation represents the total points scored in all 40 games.

Ice Cream Word Problem
Mary has 3 different flavors of ice cream. 
She has Vanilla (V), Chocolate (C), and Strawberry (S).
She has a total of 20 scoops of ice cream.
V + C + S = 20
She has Vanilla (V) and Chocolate (C) in equal amounts.
V = C
So we know that V + C = 20 - S
2V = 20 - S
V = 10 - (S/2)
Vanilla (V) and Chocolate (C) combined have 10 scoops of ice cream.
So, 2V + S = 20
Substituting the value of V from above,
2(10 - (S/2)) + S = 20
20 - S/2 + S = 20
20 + S/2 = 20
S/2 = 0
So, S = 0

Topic: basketball ### Response: 2 teams are playing basketball. Team A has 5 players on the court. Each player on team A can only play for 5 minutes before they need to be substituted out for a rest. Team A has 12 players total, so they can play for 12*5=<<12*5=60>>60 minutes before they run out of players to substitute in.
Team B has 6 players on the court. Each player on team B can play for 10 minutes before they need to be substituted out. Team B has 18 players total, so they can play for 18*10=<<18*10=180>>180 minutes before they run out of players to substitute in.
Team A will run out of players first, so the game will end after 60 minutes.

Question:There are 12 players on a soccer team. Each player has a unique number from 1 to 12. The coach wants to put together a lineup for the next game. He needs to choose a goalkeeper and 10 other players. How many different lineups can the coach create?

Solution:To solve this problem, we can use the combination formula. The coach needs to choose 1 goalkeeper from 12 players, and then choose 10 more players from the remaining 11 players.

First, the coach can choose 1 goalkeeper from 12 players in 12 ways (12C1).

Next, the coach can choose 10 more players from the remaining 11 players in 11C10 ways.

So, the total number of different lineups the coach can create is:

12C1 * 11C10 = 12 * (11! / (10! * 1!)) = 12 * (11 * 10! / (10! * 1!)) = 12 *

She rushes to the scene and finds a cat stuck on the roof. The roof is 50 feet high, and the cat is 30 feet from the edge. Wonder Woman needs to save the cat, but her lasso isn't long enough to reach the cat from the ground. She needs to get closer to the building to save the cat.

Answer:In 1974, there were 3,789,000 people living in Tokyo.
Since then, the population has increased by 2% every year.
To find out how many people are living in Tokyo in 2019, we need to calculate the population growth for 45 years (1974 to 2019).

Population growth = (initial population) * (1 + growth rate)^number of years
Population growth = 3,789,000 * (1 + 0.02)^45

Now, we can calculate the population growth:
Population growth = 3,789,000 * (1.02)^45

Topic: Batman ### Response: 
Batman is chasing the Joker and needs to cross a river. He has two options: cross the river directly or go around the river. If he crosses the river directly, it will take 10 minutes. If he goes around the river, it will take 15 minutes. Batman chooses the option that takes the least time. Which option does Batman choose?

Topic: Batman ### Response: 
Batman is on a mission to save Gotham City. He has 12 hours to save the city and needs to travel 12 miles to reach the destination. Batman can travel at a speed of 1 mile per hour.

Batman has 12 hours to travel 12 miles. He can travel at a speed of 1 mile per hour. Can Batman save Gotham City?

To solve this problem, we need to find out if Batman can travel 12 miles in 12 hours.

Batman's speed is 1 mile per hour. To travel 12 miles, he would need 12 hours. However, he only has 12 hours to save the city.

Since Batman's speed is 1 mile per hour and he has 12 hours to save the city, he can travel 12 miles in 12 hours. Therefore, Batman can save Gotham City.

Therefore, the answer is True.

Topic: volleyball ### Response: 3 teams are playing in a volleyball tournament. The winning team will get 3 points, the second team will get 2 points, and the third team will get 1 point.

If team A wins, team B comes in second, and team C comes in third, then team A will get 3 points, team B will get 2 points, and team C will get 1 point.

However, if team B wins, team A comes in second, and team C comes in third, then team B will get 3 points, team A will get 2 points, and team C will get 1 point.

In the case where team C wins, team A comes in second, and team B comes in third, then team C will get 3 points, team A will get 2 points, and team B will get 1 point.

So, the total points for each team are:

Team A: 3 points (if they win) + 2 points (if they come in second) + 1 point (if they come in third) = 6 points

Topic: Wonder Woman ### Response: 
Wonder Woman Word Problem

Wonder Woman can fly at a speed of 100 miles per hour. She can also run at a speed of 50 miles per hour. If she needs to get somewhere fast, she can use her jet which travels at a speed of 500 miles per hour.

If Wonder Woman needs to travel 300 miles, which method of transportation should she use?

To solve this problem, we need to determine which method of transportation will get Wonder Woman to her destination the fastest. We can do this by calculating the time it would take for each method of transportation to travel 300 miles.

Flying: 300 miles / 100 miles per hour = <<300/100=3>>3 hours
Running: 300 miles / 50 miles per hour = <<300/50=6>>6 hours
Jet: 300 miles / 500 miles per hour = <<300/500=0.6>>0.6 hours

Since the jet will get Wonder Woman to her destination

Topic: Serena Williams ### Response: 
Serena Williams is one of the greatest tennis players of all time. She has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles and has been ranked No. 1 in the world eight times. In this problem, we will calculate Serena's total earnings from tennis.

Total earnings = Prize money + Endorsements

Serena has won $92,745,207 in prize money over her career. She has also earned millions in endorsements from companies like Nike, Gatorade, and Delta Air Lines. Let's assume her endorsements have earned her another $50,000,000.

Total earnings = $92,745,207 + $50,000,000 = $142,745,207

Therefore, Serena Williams has earned a total of $142,745,207 from tennis.

Topic: Naruto ### Response: 
Naruto is a popular anime and manga series that follows the adventures of a young ninja named Naruto Uzumaki. In this word problem, we will explore the relationships between the different characters in the series.

Question: In the Naruto series, there are 5 Hokages (leaders of the ninja village). Each Hokage has a unique number of students they trained. The first Hokage, Hashirama Senju, trained 3 students. The second Hokage, Tobirama Senju, trained 4 students. The third Hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi, trained 6 students. The fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, trained 2 students. The fifth Hokage, Tsunade, trained 1 student.

If each Hokage trained a different number of students, how many students were trained in total?

Solution:To find the total number of students trained, we need to add the number of students trained by each Hokage.

Total students = students trained by Hashirama + students trained by Tobirama + students trained by Hiruzen + students

Topic: Power Rangers ### Response: 5 Power Rangers are on a mission to save the world. Each Power Ranger has a unique color: red, blue, pink, green, and yellow. The colors of the Power Rangers are represented by the variables r, b, p, g, and y, respectively.

The total number of Power Rangers is the sum of the number of Power Rangers of each color. So, if there are r red Power Rangers, b blue Power Rangers, p pink Power Rangers, g green Power Rangers, and y yellow Power Rangers, then the total number of Power Rangers is given by the equation:

r + b + p + g + y = 5

We know that the number of Power Rangers of each color must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, we have the following constraints:

r ‚â• 0
b ‚â• 0
p ‚â• 0
g ‚â• 0
y ‚â• 0

Now, we want to find the possible values of the variables r, b, p, g, and y that satisfy the equation and constraints.

To solve this problem, we can use the

Question:If 5 pieces of candy cost $1, how much will 20 pieces of candy cost?
Solution:Let x be the cost of 20 pieces of candy.
We have: 5 pieces of candy cost $1, so 1*5=5/1=1
We need to find the cost of 20 pieces of candy, so we set up the proportion 5/1=20/x
Cross-multiplying, we get 5x = 1*20 = 20
Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 20/5 = 4

Her height is proportional to her age.
So, if Barbie is 12 years old, then her height is 120 cm.
If she were 13 years old, how tall would she be?

Solution:Barbie's height-to-age ratio is 120 cm / 12 years = <<120/12=10>>10 cm/year.
So, for every year, her height increases by 10 cm.
Therefore, if she were 13 years old, then her height would be 120 cm + 10 cm = <<120+10=130>>130 cm.

Topic: basketball ### Response: 2019-2020 NBA season was suspended after 729 games were played. Each team played 729/30 = 24.3 games.
If we consider only the first 24 games for each team, a total of 24*30 = <<24*30=720>>720 games would have been played.
So, the number of games that were not played is 729 - 720 = <<729-720=9>>9 games.

Topic: Naruto ### Response: 11280 ramen are there initially.
Naruto ate 1280 ramen.
Remaining ramen = 11280 - 1280 = 10000.
Naruto ate half of the remaining ramen.
Half of the remaining ramen = 10000 / 2 = 5000.
So, Naruto ate 5000 ramen.

Topic: Power Rangers ### Response: 
Question:Power Rangers are a group of superheroes who protect the Earth from evil. The Power Rangers have a total of 100 members, and each member has a unique color. There are 5 colors: red, blue, yellow, pink, and black. Each color has a different number of members, and the total number of members for all colors is 100.

The problem is to find the number of members for each color.

Solution:Let's use the initial letter of each color as a variable:
R = red
B = blue
Y = yellow
P = pink
K = black

We have 5 equations for the 5 colors:
R + B + Y + P + K = 100 (Total number of members)
R + B + Y + P = K (The number of members for the first 4 colors equals the number of members for the black color)

We can solve these equations using the substitution method:
From the second equation, we can express K in terms of the other colors:
K = R + B + Y + P

Now, substitute this

Question:Batman has 10 minutes to get to the Batcave before the Joker gets there. He needs to travel 5 miles and the only way to get there is by using the Batmobile. The Batmobile can travel at a maximum speed of 125 mph, but the road to the Batcave is a winding dirt road that limits the maximum speed to 25 mph. Will Batman make it in time?

Solution:Batman needs to travel 5 miles and he has 10 minutes to do it. 

First, we need to convert the time to hours, since the speed is in miles per hour. 
10 minutes = 10/60 hours = 1/6 hours

Next, we need to find out how far Batman can travel in the given time with the speed limit of 25 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 25 mph * 1/6 hours
Distance = 25/6 miles

Since the distance to the Batcave is 5 miles, we need to find out if 25/6

Topic: Minecraft ### Response: 1. The first step is to find the total number of blocks in the world. To do this, we need to know the size of the world and the number of blocks in each chunk. The size of the world is 256 blocks wide, 256 blocks long, and 128 blocks high. Each chunk contains 16 blocks wide, 16 blocks long, and 16 blocks high.

2. The total number of blocks in the world is the size of the world times the number of chunks. The number of chunks is the total number of blocks in the world divided by the number of blocks in each chunk. So, the total number of blocks in the world is 256 * 256 * 128 * (256 * 256 * 128 / 16 * 16 * 16).

3. The total number of blocks in the world is 256 * 256 * 128 * (256 * 256 * 128 / 16 * 16 * 16) = 25

Topic: dinosaurs ### Response: 
Question: The Tyrannosaurus Rex is the largest carnivorous dinosaur. It is 40 feet long and 15 feet tall. What is the total area of the skin that covers this dinosaur?

To find the total area of the skin that covers the dinosaur, we need to find the area of each part of the dinosaur's body and then add them together.

The main part of the dinosaur's body is the torso, which is shaped like a rectangle. The length of the torso is 40 feet, and the height is 15 feet. The area of the torso is:

Area_torso = length * height
Area_torso = 40 feet * 15 feet
Area_torso = 600 square feet

Next, we need to find the area of the dinosaur's tail. The tail is shaped like a cylinder, so we need to find the circumference and the height of the tail. Let's assume the height of the tail is half the height of the torso:

Topic: ice cream ### Response: 
Question: There are 3 flavors of ice cream. Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry. You can choose to have 1, 2, or 3 scoops of ice cream. If you choose 1 scoop, you pay $5. If you choose 2 scoops, you pay $10. If you choose 3 scoops, you pay $15. How much does it cost to have 1 scoop of vanilla, 1 scoop of chocolate, and 1 scoop of strawberry?

Solution:To have 1 scoop of vanilla, 1 scoop of chocolate, and 1 scoop of strawberry, you would choose 1 scoop of each flavor. 

The cost for 1 scoop of each flavor is $5 per scoop. So, the total cost would be:

Topic: Power Rangers ### Response: 
Question:There are 5 Power Rangers. Each Power Ranger has a zord that can combine with the others to form a Megazord. The Megazord has 5 different configurations depending on which Power Ranger is in the lead. How many different combinations of Power Rangers and configurations are there?

Solution:There are 5 Power Rangers, so there are 5! (5 factorial) ways to arrange them in a line. However, since the Megazord has 5 different configurations depending on which Power Ranger is in the lead, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 5 to account for the repetitions.

So, the total number of different combinations of Power Rangers and configurations is:

(5!)/5 = 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 different combinations.

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 100 players drop in to a location. They are given 5 minutes to find weapons and other resources. After 5 minutes, the storm starts to close in. The storm closes in at a rate of 10% of the initial area every minute. The players need to stay ahead of the storm to survive.

The problem is to determine how many players can survive the storm.

Let's denote the number of players that can survive the storm as S.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the location.
Total area = 100 players * 5 minutes = 500 player-minutes

Step 2: Calculate the area that the storm closes in every minute.
Area closed in per minute = Total area * 10% = 500 player-minutes * 10% = 50 player-minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of players that can survive the storm.
Players that can survive = Total players - (Area closed in per minute / Area per player)
Area per player = Total area / Total players = 50

word_problem = """
There are 5 Power Rangers: Red, Blue, Pink, Black, and Yellow. Each Power Ranger has a special power. The Red Ranger can multiply any number by 2, the Blue Ranger can divide any number by 2, the Pink Ranger can add 1 to any number, the Black Ranger can subtract 1 from any number, and the Yellow Ranger can swap the digits of a 2-digit number.

If we start with the number 15 and apply the powers of the Power Rangers in the order they are listed (Red, Blue, Pink, Black, Yellow), what will be the final number?

Solution:First, the Red Ranger multiplies 15 by 2, giving us 30. Next, the Blue Ranger divides 30 by 2, giving us 15. The Pink Ranger then adds 1 to 15, giving us 16. The Black Ranger subtracts 1 from 16, giving us 15. Finally, the Yellow Ranger swaps the digits of 1

Topic: Serena Williams ### Response: 
Serena Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles and 14 Grand Slam doubles titles. In total, she has won 37 Grand Slam titles. However, this number is not correct. Serena has won 14 doubles titles, but each of these titles has been counted twice (once for Serena and once for her doubles partner). Therefore, the number of Grand Slam titles Serena has won is incorrect and needs to be updated.

To correct this, we need to subtract the 14 doubles titles from the total number of titles Serena has won. This will give us the correct number of Grand Slam titles Serena has won.

def correct_total_titles(total_titles, doubles_titles):
    # subtract the doubles titles from the total titles

Topic: Minecraft ### Response: 1. What is the total number of blocks in a 10x10x10 Minecraft world?
2. How many blocks are there in a 10x10x10 Minecraft world if we remove all the air blocks?

Solution:1. The total number of blocks in a 10x10x10 Minecraft world is 10*10*10 = 1000 blocks.
2. To find the number of blocks without air, we need to know the proportion of air blocks in the world. Assuming the air blocks make up 50% of the total blocks, we can calculate the number of non-air blocks as follows:

Total blocks = 1000
Air blocks = 1000 * 0.5 = 500
Non-air blocks = Total blocks - Air blocks = 1000 - 500 = 500

So, there are 500 non-air blocks in a 10x10x10 Minecraft world.

Topic: cheer leading ### Response: 12 members of a cheer leading squad are seniors. 
The number of juniors in the squad is 3 more than the number of sophomores.
There are 4 more sophomores than the number of freshmen in the squad.
The total number of members in the squad is 30.

Question: Find the number of freshmen in the squad.

Answer:Let x be the number of freshmen in the squad.
There are x+4 sophomores in the squad.
There are (x+4)+3 juniors in the squad.
The total number of members in the squad is x+x+4+ (x+4)+3 = 30.
3x+4+3 = 30.
3x+7 = 30.
3x = 23.
x = 23/3 = 7.7.
Since the number of freshmen must be an integer, there are 7 freshmen in the squad.

Topic: basketball ### Response: 
Question: A basketball player makes 50% of his 2-point shots, 33% of his 3-point shots and 67% of his free-throws. If he takes 200 shots in total, how many shots of each type does he take?

Solution:Let x be the number of 2-point shots, y be the number of 3-point shots, and z be the number of free-throws. We know that x + y + z = 200, and we want to find the values of x, y, and z that satisfy this equation and the given percentages.

Let's denote the percentage of shots made as P(x) for 2-point shots, P(y) for 3-point shots, and P(z) for free-throws. We know that:

P(x) = 0.5
P(y) = 0.33
P(z) = 0.67

We also know that the total number of shots is 200, so

Topic: Black Panther ### Response: 1000 years ago, a meteorite made of Vibranium crashed in Wakanda. The Wakandans used the Vibranium to develop their technology and culture. However, they also had to defend their land from invaders who wanted to steal the Vibranium. To do this, they built a sound-based shield around the entire country. The shield was powered by a Vibranium-based generator.

The generator has been running for 1000 years, and it is starting to wear down. The generator needs to be replaced soon, or the shield will fail. The Wakandans have been mining Vibranium for centuries, and they have a large stockpile of the metal. They can use this stockpile to build a new generator.

The current generator is 1000 years old, and it is made of 1000 kg of Vibranium. The new generator needs to be more powerful, so it will require 1.5 times the amount of Vibranium as the old generator.

How much Vibranium will the new generator need?

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 
Question: In Fortnite, there are four different types of materials that can be used to build structures: wood, stone, metal, and glass. Each type of material has a different durability rating, with wood being the weakest and glass being the strongest. 

A player has 1000 total building materials, and they need to decide how many of each type of material to gather. The player wants to maximize the durability of their structures, so they should prioritize gathering glass over the other materials. 

Let's denote the amount of wood as w, stone as s, metal as m, and glass as g. We know that w + s + m + g = 1000. The player should aim to have as much glass as possible, so we can assume that they will gather the maximum amount of glass (g = 1000). This means that there will be no wood, stone, or metal left to gather (w = s = m = 0).

However, the problem states that the player needs to gather all four types of materials. Therefore, we need to find a way to distribute the 1

Topic: unicorns ### Response: 
Question:There are 3 types of unicorns: rainbow, sparkle, and star. Rainbow unicorns have 7 colors and can fly at a speed of 55 mph. Sparkle unicorns have 3 colors and can fly at a speed of 35 mph. Star unicorns have 11 colors and can fly at a speed of 65 mph. Which type of unicorn is the best?

To determine the best type of unicorn, we will calculate the total score for each type of unicorn. The score will be based on the number of colors and the speed of flying. We will assign 1 point for each color and 1 point for every 5 mph of speed.

Solution:
def unicorn_score(colors, speed):
    return colors + (speed / 5)

Topic: Captain America ### Response: 1. Captain America can run 1500 meters in 10 minutes.
2. We need to find out how many meters he can run in 20 minutes.
3. To do this, we first find out how many meters he can run in 1 minute - 1500 meters / 10 minutes = <<1500/10=150>>150 meters/minute
4. Then, we multiply this by the number of minutes we're interested in - 150 meters/minute * 20 minutes = <<150*20=3000>>3000 meters
5. So, Captain America can run 3000 meters in 20 minutes.

2. Next, we need to find out how many stacks of blocks Steve has. We know that he has 4 stacks, so we'll use that number in our calculation.
3. Now, we need to find out how many blocks Steve has in total. To do this, we'll multiply the number of blocks in a stack by the number of stacks Steve has: 64 blocks/stack * 4 stacks = 256 blocks
4. Finally, we need to find out how many blocks Steve has left after building a house. We know that the house uses 12 blocks, so we'll subtract that number from the total number of blocks Steve has: 256 blocks - 12 blocks = 244 blocks

Topic: Pok√©mon ### Response: 2019 is the year of Pokemon, as it is the 20th anniversary of the release of the first games. To celebrate, we are going to calculate how many Pokemon there are in total.

First, we need to know how many generations of Pokemon there are. As of 2019, there are 7 generations of Pokemon.

Next, we need to know how many Pokemon are in each generation. The number of Pokemon in each generation is as follows:

Generation 1: 151
Generation 2: 100
Generation 3: 135
Generation 4: 107
Generation 5: 156
Generation 6: 72
Generation 7: 88

Now, we can calculate the total number of Pokemon by adding the number of Pokemon in each generation.

Topic: Pok√©mon ### Response: 100 trainers are participating in a Pok√©mon tournament. The tournament is a one-on-one battle, and the winner will advance to the next round. In the first round, there are 100 trainers, and only 1 can win. In the second round, there are 99 trainers left, and only 1 can win. In the third round, there are 98 trainers left, and only 1 can win, and so on.

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the total number of trainers that win a battle:

Sum = n/2 * (a + l)

where n is the number of terms (number of rounds), a is the first term (number of trainers in the first round), and l is the last term (number of trainers in the last round).

In this case, n = 100, a = 100, and l = 1.

Pokemon Word Problem
There are 8 gyms in the Kanto region. Each gym has a leader that specializes in a specific type of Pokemon. The types are:
- Fire
- Water
- Electric
- Grass
- Ice
- Fighting
- Poison
- Ground
A trainer must defeat all 8 gym leaders to become the champion. The problem is, the trainer only has 6 Pokemon in their party, and each Pokemon can only have 4 moves. This means the trainer can only use a maximum of 24 moves in battle.

The question is, how many different combinations of 24 moves can be made from the 8 types of Pokemon?

This problem can be solved using the concept of combinations in mathematics.

The Seahawks have had a total of 19 head coaches, including the current coach, Pete Carroll. The team has played a total of 524 games, including both regular season and playoff games. The Seahawks have won 285 games and lost 239 games.

The team's winning percentage is calculated by dividing the number of games won by the total number of games played. The Seahawks have a winning percentage of 0.534. To calculate this, we can use the formula:

Winning Percentage = (Games Won / Total Games) * 100

Topic: Batman ### Response: 
Batman is chasing after the Joker and needs to cross a river. He has a Bat-Boat that can travel at a speed of 100 km/h and the river is 500 meters wide. Batman needs to get to the other side of the river as quickly as possible.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for distance: distance = speed * time. We need to convert the width of the river from meters to kilometers, so 500 meters = 0.5 kilometers.

We can also convert Batman's speed from km/h to m/s by multiplying by 5/18, so 100 km/h = 25 m/s.

Now we can plug these values into the formula:

distance = speed * time
0.5 km = 25 m/s * time

To find the time it takes for Batman to cross the river, we can rearrange the formula:

time = distance / speed
time = 0.5 km / 25 m/s

Now we can calculate the time:

Question: There are 50 dogs in the dog park. Some are big dogs and some are small dogs. If the number of big dogs is 10 more than the number of small dogs, how many small dogs are there?
Solution:

    # total number of dogs
    total_dogs = 50
    # number of big dogs is 10 more than the number of small dogs
    # let x be the number of small dogs
    # then x + (x + 10) = total_dogs
    # solving the equation we get:
    x = (total_dogs - 10) / 2

Topic: field hockey ### Response: 12 players are on the field hockey team. They have 10 games in the season. The team has 3 coaches. The team needs to raise $500 for new equipment. They are having a car wash to raise money. Each player will wash 10 cars. The players will also sell programs at the games. They will sell 2 programs per game. The programs cost $10 each. The team will also sell concessions at the games. They will make $10 per game from concessions.

The team will make $120 from car washing because 12 x 10 = <<12*10=120>>120
They will make $200 from selling programs because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20
They will make $100 from concessions because 10 x 10 = <<10*10=100>>100
They will make $420 total because 120 + 200 + 100 = <<120+200

def spiderman_solution():
    #There are 40 $5 bills
    bills_5 = 40
    #There are 30 $10 bills
    bills_10 = 30
    #The rest are $20 bills
    bills_20 = 100 - bills_5 - bills_10

Topic: cats ### Response: 1 cat has 4 legs
1 cat has 2 ears
1 cat has 1 tail
total number of cats is 3
total number of legs is 4*3=12
total number of ears is 2*3=6
total number of tails is 1*3=3
Question:How many cats have more than 4 legs?
Answer:Let's think about the multi-choice question.
Let's assume the number of cats with more than 4 legs is x
The total number of legs is 12
There are 3 cats with 4 legs so the number of legs for these cats is 3*4=12
There are x cats with more than 4 legs so the number of legs for these cats is x*(4+y) where y is the number of extra legs
12 = 12 + x*(4+y)
12 = 12 + 4x + xy
12 = 4x + xy
12 = xy + 4x
12-4x = xy
12-4x

Spiderman is trying to save the city from a bomb that has been planted by the Green Goblin. The bomb is set to go off in 7 hours and Spiderman has 1 hour to get to the bomb and defuse it. 

If Spiderman can travel at a speed of 30 miles per hour, how far can he travel in 1 hour?

To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = speed √ó time

    # The area of a pizza is 8 slices
    total_pizza_area = 8
    # Each slice is 1/8 of the whole pizza
    slice_fraction = 1/8
    # Therefore, the area of each pizza slice is 1/8 of the whole pizza

Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 2020 was a difficult year for many people. Patrick Mahomes, the star quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, was one of the few people who had a great year. He led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance and was named the Super Bowl MVP for the second time in a row. He also signed a 10-year contract extension with the Chiefs worth $450 million, making him the highest-paid athlete in sports history.

To put Mahomes' contract in perspective, the average salary of an NFL player is $2 million per year. Therefore, the average NFL player would need to play for 225 years to earn as much as Mahomes will earn in 10 years.

Topic: LeBron James ### Response: 2018 was a historic year for LeBron James. In that year, he scored 2,065 points, had 517 assists, and 500 rebounds. If you add all these together, you get 3,082. This was the first time a player had ever scored more than 2,000 points and had more than 500 rebounds and 500 assists in the same season.

To find the total number of points, assists, and rebounds, you can use the following formula:

Total = Points + Assists + Rebounds

Let's plug in the values from 2018:

Total = 2,065 + 517 + 500
Total = 3,082

So, the total number of points, assists, and rebounds for LeBron James in 2018 is 3,082.

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 100 players drop into a map to fight for survival. They are divided into 25 teams of 4 players each. Each team has to find a specific type of weapon to be able to damage other players. 

The problem: Find the total number of players that can damage other players.

Solution: There are 25 teams of 4 players each. Each team needs to find a specific type of weapon to be able to damage other players. Since each team has 4 players, all 4 players in each team can damage other players if they find the required weapon.

So, the total number of players that can damage other players is:

25 teams * 4 players per team = 100 players

Therefore, all 100 players can damage other players if their team finds the required weapon.
