### Response:import math

# Given, Perimeter of square paper is 32 cm
# Therefore, side of the square is perimeter/4
perimeter = 32
side = perimeter / 4

# Area of the square paper is side^2

Question question_1510 solution:Let's write a program.

### Response:from math import sqrt

# side length of each square
side_length = 2

# total area of the smaller squares
total_area = 92

# calculate the number of squares
num_squares = total_area / (side_length ** 2)

# The wire is cut into several smaller pieces, each bent into a square. 
# So, the original length of the wire is the perimeter of the squares times the number of squares.
# Since each square has 4 sides, the perimeter of each square is 4 * side_length.
# Therefore, the original length of the wire is 4 * side_length * num_squares.

original_length = 4 * side_length * num_squares

print(original_length)
