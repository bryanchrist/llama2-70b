Topic: volleyball ### Response:  Question: 

In volleyball, each team has 6 players on the court. 

A volleyball game has 5 sets. 

Each set is won by the team that is the first to 25 points, but with no team ever leading by more than 2 points.

How many points does each team get per set on average?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Each team has 6 players
    players_per_team = 6
    #A volleyball game has 5 sets
    sets = 5
    #Each set is won by the team that is the first to 25 points, but with no team ever leading by more than 2 points.
    #So, a set can end when one team has 25 points and the other team has 23, 24, or 26 points.
    #Each team can get 24, 25, or 26 points per set.
    #The average is (24*3 + 25*2 + 26)/3
    points_per_set_average = (24*3 + 25*2 + 26)/3
    #The answer is
