Topic: Pokémon ### Response:  Question: In the Pokémon games, a Pokémon's experience points (XP) is used to determine its level. 
A Pokémon's XP is calculated by the formula: XP = base_XP * level * (level + 1) / 5 
where base_XP is a constant depending on the Pokémon. 
For example, a Pikachu's base_XP is 50.
