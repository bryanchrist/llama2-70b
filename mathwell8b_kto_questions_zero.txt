Topic: Steph Curry 1. Steph Curry is a 3-point shooting machine. He has made 288 3-pointers in the 2021-2022 season. 2. He has made 50% of his 3-point shots. 3. How many 3-point shots has he missed? 4. The answer is (3-pointers made) / (0.5) = (3-pointers missed) + (3-pointers made) 5. Therefore, the answer is (288) / (0.5) = (3-pointers missed) + 288 6. We can solve for the number of 3-point shots missed by subtracting 288 from both sides of the equation. 7. The answer is (288) / (0.5) - 288 = (3-pointers missed) 8. The answer is (288) / (0.5) - 288 = 3-pointers missed 9. Therefore,
