Question: A 24-scoop ice cream sundae has 6 scoops each of 4 different flavors.  How many scoops of the most popular flavor can you add to the sundae such that each flavor is still represented by an equal number of scoops?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The sundae has 24 scoops, and each of the 4 flavors is represented by 6 scoops.
    #To add more scoops of the most popular flavor while still maintaining an equal number of scoops for each flavor,
    #we must add the same number of scoops to each flavor.
    #24 scoops / 4 flavors = 6 scoops per flavor
    #6 scoops of the most popular flavor is added to the sundae.

Question: A 12-foot by 16-foot rectangle is to be tiled with 6-inch by 3-inch tiles. How many tiles will be required?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the rectangle to inches
    #12 feet = 12 * 12 = 144 inches
    #16 feet = 16 * 12 = 192 inches
    #The second step is to calculate the area of the rectangle
    #Area = length * width
    #144 * 192 = 27648 square inches
    #The third step is to calculate the area of one tile
    #6 * 3 = 18 square inches
    #The fourth step is to calculate the number of tiles required
    #27648 / 18 = 1536 tiles
    #The answer is

2000 of the lollipops are red, 3000 of the lollipops are blue, and the rest are a mixture of other colors. 

How many of the lollipops are not red or blue?

Solution:
def solution():
    #The candy store sells 10000 lollipops

    lollipops_blue = 3000
    #The answer is
    result = lollipops_total - lollipops_red - lollipops_blue

Question: 12000 people live in a small town. 1/4 of the people in the town are under 18. 55% of the adults in the town are women. How many men over 18 live in the town?
Solution:
def solution():
    #Total population
    total_population = 12000
    #1/4 of the people are under 18
    under_18 = total_population / 4

    women = adults * 0.55
    #Men are the adults minus the women

Question: A 20-foot by 15-foot by 10-foot box is to be filled with 4-inch by 4-inch by 4-inch cubes. How many cubes will be required?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the box to inches
    #20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches
    #15 feet = 15 * 12 = 180 inches
    #10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches
    #The second step is to calculate the volume of the box
    #Volume = length * width * height
    #240 * 180 * 120 = 4608000 cubic inches
    #The third step is to calculate the volume of one cube
    #4 * 4 * 4 = 64 cubic inches
    #The fourth step is to calculate the number of cubes required

Question: A 12-foot by 16-foot rectangle is to be tiled with 6-inch by 3-inch tiles. How many tiles will be required?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the rectangle to inches
    #12 feet = 12 * 12 = 144 inches
    #16 feet = 16 * 12 = 192 inches
    #The second step is to calculate the area of the rectangle
    #Area = length * width
    #144 * 192 = 27648 square inches
    #The third step is to calculate the area of one tile
    #6 * 3 = 18 square inches

Question: A 12-sided die has 12 sides, numbered from 1 to 12. 

What is the probability of rolling a 6 or 8 on a 12-sided die?

(Probability is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of an event. 

A probability of 1 means that the event is certain to occur, and a probability of 0 means that the event is impossible. 

The probability of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities.)

Solution:
def solution():
    #A 12-sided die has 12 sides, numbered from 1 to 12
    sides = 12
    #The probability of rolling a 6 or 8 on a 12-sided die is
    probability_6 = 1/sides

Solution:
def solution():

    #1/4 of the slices are strawberry
    strawberry_slices = slices / 4
    #The answer is

Solution:

Question: A soccer team has 11 players. 

The coach has 20 jerseys in the locker room. 

He notices that 1/2 of the jerseys have a tear in them. 

How many jerseys does the coach have that are not torn?
Solution:

Question: 24000 people live in a small town. 1/4 of the people in the town are under 18. 55% of the adults in the town are women. How many men over 18 live in the town?

Solution:
def solution():
    #Total population
    total_population = 24000
    #1/4 of the people are under 18
    under_18 = total_population / 4
    #Adults are the total population minus the under 18
    adults = total_population - under_18
    #55% of the adults are women
    women = adults * 0.55
    #Men are the adults minus the women
    men = adults - women
    #The answer is

A 12-foot by 16-foot rectangle is to be tiled with 6-inch by 3-inch tiles. How many tiles will be required?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the rectangle to inches
    #12 feet = 12 * 12 = 144 inches
    #16 feet = 16 * 12 = 192 inches
    #The second step is to calculate the area of the rectangle
    #Area = length * width
    #144 * 192 = 27648 square inches
    #The third step is to calculate the area of one tile
    #6 * 3 = 18 square inches
    #The fourth step is to calculate the number of tiles required
    #27648 / 18 = 1536 tiles

Question: 

A 12-foot by 16-foot rectangle is to be tiled with 6-inch by 3-inch tiles. How many tiles will be required?

Solution:

def solution():

    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the rectangle to inches

    #12 feet = 12 * 12 = 144 inches

    #16 feet = 16 * 12 = 192 inches

    #The second step is to calculate the area of the rectangle

    #Area = length * width

    #144 * 192 = 27648 square inches

    #The third step is to calculate the area of one tile

    #6 * 3 = 18 square inches

    #The fourth step is to calculate the number of tiles required

    #27648 / 18 = 1536 tiles

Question: A 12-foot by 16-foot rectangle is to be tiled with 6-inch by 3-inch tiles. How many tiles will be required?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The first step is to convert the dimensions of the rectangle to inches
    #12 feet = 12 * 12 = 144 inches
    #16 feet = 16 * 12 = 192 inches
    #The second step is to calculate the area of the rectangle
    #Area = length * width
    #144 * 192 = 27648 square inches
    #The third step is to calculate the area of one tile
    #6 * 3 = 18 square inches
    #The fourth step is to calculate the number of tiles required
    #27648 / 18 = 1536 tiles
    #The answer is
    result = 1536
