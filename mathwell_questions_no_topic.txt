Question: A 24-scoop ice cream sundae has 6 scoops each of 4 different flavors.  How many scoops of the most popular flavor can you add to the sundae such that each flavor is still represented by an equal number of scoops?
Solution:
def solution():
    #The sundae has 24 scoops, and each of the 4 flavors is represented by 6 scoops.
    #To add more scoops of the most popular flavor while still maintaining an equal number of scoops for each flavor,
    #we must add the same number of scoops to each flavor.
    #24 scoops / 4 flavors = 6 scoops per flavor
    #6 scoops of the most popular flavor is added to the sundae.
    #The answer is 6.
    return 6
