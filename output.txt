Factor in an additional 10% for health insurance, $100 per year for food, and $250 a year for toys and treats. How much can you expect to pay for your new member of the family? Solution: def solution():
   #A chocolate lab puppy costs between $550 and $750
    puppy_cost = 550

### Response: Question: Dana is a scuba diver who recovers precious objects from the seafloor. She is hired to find treasure lost in the sea during a naval battle fought centuries ago. At a depth of 10 feet, she finds a silver coin. The deeper she goes, the less oxygen she has, so the more she has to come up to the surface for air. Each time she comes up, she wastes 7 minutes. At 30 feet, she finds a golden pocket watch. The watch is water-logged, which makes it 3 times as heavy as it was on dry land. At 60 feet, she finds a diamond-encrusted crucifix (the crucifix is 10 times as heavy as the silver coin). How much time did it take her to dive to 10, 30 and 60 feet, and what is the difference in time it took her to find all

    #I doubled my money and earned $100 + 10*100 * (1 + 0.1) + 100 * 2 = $400 in interest.
    money_interest = money_initial * (1 + interest) ** number_of_years
    money_doubled = money_initial * 2
    #The total in the bank was $400 + $400 + 2*$500 = $<<400+400+2*500=1900>>1900
    money_total = money_interest + money_doubled + 500*2
    #The answer is
    result = money_total
