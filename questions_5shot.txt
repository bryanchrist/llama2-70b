### Response: Question: 120 5th-grade students in Ms. Smith’s school are in 4th quadrant of their in-school carnival. 140 3rd-grade students are in the 3rd quadrant, and twice as many 2nd-grade students are in the 2nd quadrant. How many 1st-grade students are in the 1st quadrant to balance the carnival? Solution: def solution():

The cost of 10552545 lumber at a given price depends on the number of boards that 10552545 lumber is sawn into. Each 10552545 board is 16 feet (ft) long, 2 inches (in) thick and 8 in. wide. A 10552545 board that is 8 in. by 2 in. has an area of 2*8 = <<8*2=16>>16 square inches.

## 10552545 lumber is $10552545 times the board area in square inches.

## The number of boards in a 10552545 board foot of lumber is 10552545/16.
## 10552545 lumber is $10552545 times the number of boards.

### Response: Question: Shaq is 7 feet, 6 inches tall.  Allen Iverson is 6 feet, 1 inch.  Inches are a sub-unit of the more general unit foot.  A unit of measurement can only be added if the units match, and the resulting number must then be converted into the more general unit.  Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, we start by determining the number of feet in Shaq's height. 7 feet, 6 inches is 7*12 + 6 = <<7*12+6=94>>94 inches.  Converting 94 inches to feet, we have 94/12 = <<94/12=8>>8 feet.  Allen Iverson's height can also be converted to feet. 6 feet, 1 inch is 6*12 + 1 = 72 inches.  Converting 72 inches to feet, we have 72/12 = <<72/12=6>>6 feet.  The difference in height is 8-6 = <<8-6=2>>2 feet.  Shaq is 2 feet taller than Allen Iverson. Solution: def solution():
    #Shaq is 7 feet, 6 inches tall

### Response: Question: A tire company is selling 4 tires that were previously $150 each for $100.  This sale price is only valid when all 4 tires are bought, otherwise they are still $150.  If the customer already had 2 tires they needed to replaced and then they bought the other 2 for $100, how much of a bargain did they get? Solution: def solution():

### Response: Question: This is a 9214776 step word problem. Step 1: I ate lunch at a sit-down restaurant and my total bill was $2834218. I tipped 15% on the bill. I rounded the tip up to the nearest dollar. Tip Amount: $2834218* 0.15 = $<<2834218*0.15=42.51>>42.51. Rounded up, the tip was $43. Step 2: I also paid with a coupon that was for $10 off of a $2834218 or more bill. This brought the $2834218 bill down to $2834218 - $10 = $2734218. Step

### Response: Question: 316 16116958. Python interpreter. There are two numbers to guess: num1 and num2. num1 is a positive integer less than 200. num2 is the square of num1. A player can make up to 20 guesses. When the player guesses the correct answer, the player will win $100. When the player has used all of the guesses, the player will be notified. Write a Python program that will do the following: 1. 100. Ask the player to input num1 and num2. 2. If the player’s guess for num1 is out of range, the Python interpreter will generate a new number and ask the player for the second guess. The new number is num1 + 200. 3. If the player’s guess for num2 is out of range, the Python interpreter will generate a new number and ask the player for the second guess. The new number is num2 + (num1 * 2). 4. Output the result to the player.

### Response: Question: Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara plan to add 10 hedges to their garden. They also plan to add 4 more fences and to replace every third fence they've installed with a gate. If they've already installed 40 fences, how many gates will they have at the end? Solution: def solution():
    #The O'Haras plan on adding 10 hedges
    hedges = 10
    #They plan on adding 4 more fences
    fences = 4
    #Every third fence should have a gate
    gates_per_fence = fences / 3

### Response: Question: There were 135 guests at the party. 30% of the guests were from out of town. The caterer ordered 115 1/4 pound hamburgers. How much hamburger meat, in ounces, was left over at the end of the party? Solution: def solution():
    #135 guests is 100%
    guests_total = 135
    #30% were from out of town, so 100% - 30% = 70% of guests were local
    guests_local = 100 - 30
    #70% of guests are local, or 0.70 * 135 = <<0.70 * 135 = 94.5>>94.5
    guests_local = 94.5
    #94.5 guests ate 1/4 pound hamburgers, so 94.5 * 1/4 = 23.625 pounds eaten
    pounds_eaten = 23.625
    #The caterer ordered 115 1/4 pound hamburgers, so 115 * 1/4 = <<115*1/4=28.75>>28.75 pounds
    pounds_ordered = 28.75
    #28.75 pounds - 23.625 pounds eaten = <<28.75-23.625=5.125>>5.125 pounds

### Response: Question: Mr. Moseby, the administrator of the Park Place Retirement Home, has to take into account the fact that 396364 of his residents have a wheelchair, meaning 2 other people must help them during emergency evacuations. There are 41 residents total. How many evacuation routes will have to be set up accounting for the wheelchair-bound residents? Solution: def solution():
