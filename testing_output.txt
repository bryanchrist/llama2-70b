### Response: Question: Melanie has $45. She shops at a grocery store for 2 hours and spends $18. She then goes to a bakery and spends $12. Melanie is thirsty and so she buys a soda for $3. She now has no money left. How much money did Melanie spend per hour at the grocery store? Solution: def solution():
#Melanie started with $45
money_initial = 45
#Melanie spent $18 at the grocery store
grocery_store_spent = 18
#Melanie spent $12 at the bakery
bakery_spent = 12
#Melanie bought a soda for $3
soda_spent = 3
#Melanie's total spending is
total_spent = 18 + 12 + 3
#Melanie has no money left
money_left = 0
#Melanie at the grocery store for 2 hours
grocery_store_time = 2
#Time at the bakery and soda store is 0

#The total time is
total_time = 2 + 0 + 0

### Response: Question: Dana is a scuba diver who recovers precious objects from the seafloor. She is hired to find treasure lost in the sea during a naval battle fought centuries ago. At a depth of 10 feet, she finds a silver coin. The deeper she goes, the less oxygen she has, so the more she has to come up to the surface for air. Each time she comes up, she wastes 7 minutes. At 30 feet, she finds a golden pocket watch. The watch is water-logged, which makes it 3 times as heavy as it was on dry land. At 60 feet, she finds a diamond-encrusted crucifix (the crucifix is 10 times as heavy as the silver coin). How much time did it take her to dive to 10, 30 and 60 feet, and what is the difference in time it took her to find all
### Response: Question: Dianne is Dunkin' Brands CFO. She has to cut 5% of the budget for donuts and also for the coffee. Donuts cost $1.5 each and coffee cost 50 cents per cup. Dunkin' Brands sells 3.5 million cups of coffee and 2.3 million donuts a day. How much is Dunkin' Brands daily budget for both the donuts and the coffee? Solution: def solution():

### Response: Question: A car is motoring along the highway at 60 miles per hour. 20 minutes later, the car is 3 times as far from a van that is also motoring on the highway. Three hours later, the car and van are at the same place on the highway. The van was traveling 10 miles slower than the car. How many miles has the van traveled? Solution: def solution():

### Response: Question: All the pizza parlors in the neighborhood are running pizza delivery specials.  Pizza King's special is a 30% discount for cash-paying customers.  Pizza Heaven is offering 25% off for new customers, and Pizza Supreme is giving a 2-topping pizza for the price of a 1-topping pizza.  If all three places have the same number of toppings available and each topping costs $1.25, how much does the cheapest pepperoni-and-sausage pizza cost? Solution:

### Response: Question: For my 18th birthday, my parents gave me $100. I deposited the money in a bank and earned 10% interest every year. The bank did so well and double everyone's money. Because of my age, I needed a legal guardian to withdraw the money. It took me 2 weeks for my guardian to be appointed which meant I had to pay 2 $500 legal fees. How much money was left in my bank account? Solution: def solution():
    #I got $100 for my 18th birthday and earned 10% interest every year
    money_initial = 100

    #My interest was compounded
    compounded_interest = True
    #I doubled my money and earned $100 + 10*100 * (1 + 0.1) + 100 * 2 = $400 in interest.
    money_interest = money_initial * (1 + interest) ** number_of_years
    money_doubled = money_initial * 2
    #The total in the bank was $400 + $400 + 2*$500 = $<<400+400+2*500=1900>>1900
    money_total = money_interest + money_doubled + 500*2
    #The answer is
