DEPRECATION: pyodbc 4.0.0-unsupported has a non-standard version number. pip 23.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of pyodbc or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming version number. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12063

ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
spyder 4.1.5 requires keyring; sys_platform != "linux2", which is not installed.
spyder 4.1.5 requires pyqt5<5.13; python_version >= "3", which is not installed.
spyder 4.1.5 requires pyqtwebengine<5.13; python_version >= "3", which is not installed.
google-auth 2.20.0 requires urllib3<2.0, but you have urllib3 2.0.4 which is incompatible.
