Collecting transformers==4.33.2 (from -r requirements.txt (line 2))
  Using cached transformers-4.33.2-py3-none-any.whl (7.6 MB)

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested huggingface_hub==0.16.4
    transformers 4.33.2 depends on huggingface-hub<1.0 and >=0.15.1
    evaluate 0.4.0 depends on huggingface-hub>=0.7.0
    peft 0.8.2 depends on huggingface-hub>=0.17.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
