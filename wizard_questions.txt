Topic: football ### Response: 1. Problem: 45 football players are divided into three groups: offensive players, defensive players, and special teams players. We know that there are 11 offensive players and 11 defensive players. We want to find out how many players are special teams players.

2. Solution:First, we know that there are 45 football players in total and 11 of them are offensive players. So, we can subtract the number of offensive players from the total number of players to find out how many players are not in the offensive team:

45 players (total) - 11 players (offensive) = 34 players (not offensive)

3. Now, we know that there are 34 players who are not in the offensive team. Out of these 34 players, 11 of them are defensive players. So, we can subtract the number of defensive players from the number of players who are not in the offensive team to find out how many players are special teams players:

34 players (not offensive) - 11 players (defensive) = 23 players
Topic: Patrick Mahomes ### Response: 1. Patrick Mahomes is good in baseball, golf, basketball, and swimming. We would like to find the number of sports he can't play. 

2. We know that Patrick can play 4 sports: baseball, golf, basketball, and swimming. 

3. To find the number of sports he can't play, we can use the concept of complementary probability. Complementary probability is the measure of how unsuccessful a random event is, which is calculated by subtracting the probability of the successful event from 1. 

4. In this case, the successful event is playing a sport, and the unsuccessful event is not playing a sport. So, the probability of Patrick being able to play a sport is the number of sports he can play divided by the total number of sports available. 

5. Since the number of sports Patrick can play is 4, and the total number of sports available is 5 (assuming there are 5 sports in total), the probability of Patrick being able to play a sport is 4/5. 

6. Now, to find the complementary probability (the probability of Patrick not
Topic: basketball ### Response: 2. How many times did he shoot in total?
Step 1: Identify the total number of shots taken.

Topic: field hockey ### Response: 1. We know that a field hockey team is made up of eleven players.
2. We know that there are two teams playing against each other. So, we have a total of 11 players + 11 players = 22 players playing the game.
3. Now, let's break down the position of each player. We know that there are:
   - 1 goalkeeper
   - 5 defenders
   - 8 midfielders
   - 6 forwards
4. If we add up the number of players in each position, we get:
   1 (goalkeeper) + 5 (defenders) + 8 (midfielders) + 6 (forwards) = 19 players
5. We know that there are 22 players in total, so to find the number of players that are missing, we subtract the number of players we have from the total number of players:
   22 (total players) - 19 (players in each position) = 3 players
6. Therefore, the answer is: There are 3 players missing from our list of field hockey positions.

Topic: Super Mario ### Response: 
Question:In the Super Mario game, Mario can earn coins by defeating enemies or collecting coins on his way. If he has a "Coin Fruit", he gets 10 additional coins for each coin he collects. We know that he has collected 100 coins. How many coins does he have after eating the "Coin Fruit"?

Solution:First, we need to understand the problem. Mario collects 100 coins and gets a "Coin Fruit" which gives him 10 additional coins for each coin he collects.

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- Mario collects 100 coins (coins_collected = 100).
- When he eats the "Coin Fruit", he gets 10 additional coins for each coin he collects (coins_per_fruit = 10).

Step 2: Write down the equation to calculate the total coins Mario has after eating the "Coin Fruit".

Topic: Steph Curry ### Response: 1. First, we need to define our variables. Let's denote:
   - `p`: the number of points Steph Curry scored in the first half
   - `s`: the number of points Steph Curry scored in the second half
   - `t`: the total number of points Steph Curry scored in the game

2. Now, we know that Steph Curry scored 't' points in the entire game. Since there are two halves in a game, we can express this as:
   - Total points = Points in the first half + Points in the second half
   - t = p + s

3. Additionally, we are given that Steph Curry scored 38 points in the second half. So, we can substitute this value into our equation:
   - t = p + 38

4. Our goal is to find the number of points Steph Curry scored in the first half, which is `p`. To do this, we need to solve for `p` in the equation `t = p + 38`. 

5. To find the value of `p`, we can rearrange the equation and

Step 1: We need to create a plan to feed the cats. Let's assume we have a can of cat food for each cat.

Step 2: We need to find out how long it takes to feed one cat. Let's assume it takes 5 seconds to feed one cat.

Step 3: Now, we need to calculate the total time it will take to feed all the cats. To do this, we will multiply the time it takes to feed one cat by the total number of cats.

Total time = (Time to feed one cat) x (Number of cats)
Total time = 5 seconds x 100 cats = 500 seconds

So, it will take 500 seconds to feed all 100 cats.

The answer is: it will take 500 seconds to feed all 100 cats.
Topic: Taylor Swift ### Response: 

Question: Taylor Swift is known for her love of cats. If she has 5 cats and each cat has 4 legs, how many legs are there in total?

Solution:First, we need to find the number of legs each cat has. Since Taylor Swift has 5 cats and each cat has 4 legs, we can multiply 5 (the number of cats) by 4 (the number of legs each cat has):

5 cats * 4 legs = 20 legs

So, Taylor Swift's cats have a total of 20 legs.

Now, let's write the solution in a more detailed, step-by-step manner using a Python function:

```python
def solution():
    number_of_cats = 5
    number_of_legs_each_cat_has = 4

Topic: Captain America ### Response: 

Step 1: Understand the problem
Captain America and his team need to find and destroy 100 Hydra targets. We need to find out how many targets each person needs to destroy in order to complete the mission in the least amount of time.

Step 2: Define the variables
Let's assume that Captain America has a team of N members, including himself.

Let T be the total number of targets, which is 100 in this case.
Let t be the number of targets each team member needs to destroy.

Step 3: Set up the equation
Since the team needs to destroy all 100 targets, we can write the equation as:
NT = T

where N is the number of team members, and T is the total number of targets.

Step 4: Solve the equation for t
We can solve the equation for t by dividing both sides by N:
t = T/N

Since T = 100, we have:
t = 100/N

Step 5: Determine the value of N

Topic: Harry Potter ### Response: 1. Step 1: Identify the problem
Harry Potter wants to know how many points he earned in his Quidditch match. He scored 10 points for each goal and lost 10 points for each foul. He scored 5 goals and committed 3 fouls. We need to calculate the total points Harry earned.

2. Step 2: Write down the known information
Harry scored 5 goals, and each goal is worth 10 points. So, the points he earned from goals are:
5 goals * 10 points/goal = 50 points

Harry committed 3 fouls, and each foul results in a loss of 10 points. So, the points he lost from fouls are:
3 fouls * 10 points/foul = -30 points

3. Step 3: Calculate the total points Harry earned
Now, we need to add the points Harry earned from goals and subtract the points he lost from fouls.
Total points = Points from goals + Points from fouls
Total points = 50 points + (-30 points)

Let a be the number of swimming strokes per minute and d be the distance swam in meters.

Step 2: Write the word problem.
Bob can swim 100 meters in 2 minutes using the breaststroke. Bob switches to the freestyle stroke, which allows him to swim twice as fast. While swimming freestyle, Bob can swim 200 meters in 2 minutes.

Step 3: Find the relationship between strokes, distance, and time.
Let's find the number of strokes Bob takes for each stroke style:

1. Breaststroke:
Bob swims 100 meters in 2 minutes, so he swims 50 meters in 1 minute (since 100 meters / 2 minutes = 50 meters/minute).
Let a_breaststroke be the number of strokes per minute.
Then, a_breaststroke * 1 minute = 50 meters
a_breaststroke = 5

Topic: Pokémon ### Response: 

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let's say that you have 329 Pokémon cards. Unfortunately, you lose 10 cards every day. 

Let x be the number of days. 
Let y be the number of cards remaining. 

Step 2: Write the equation.
We can write an exponential decay equation to represent the relationship between the number of cards and the number of days:

y = 329 * (0.9)^x

Step 3: Calculate the number of cards remaining after a certain number of days.
For example, if you want to find out how many cards are left after 10 days, you can plug in x = 10 into the equation:

y = 329 * (0.9)^10

Step 4: Calculate the result.
y ≈ 329 * 0.3487
y ≈ 113

Step 5: Interpret the result.
So, after 10 days, you will have approximately 113 cards remaining.

Topic: Barbie ### Response: 1. We need to define a problem. Let's assume we have two tables and Barbie has 7 dolls. We need to find out how many dolls Barbie can put on each table.

2. First, we need to define the total number of dolls and the number of tables. Let's assume we have:
   Total dolls = 7
   Number of tables = 2

3. To find out how many dolls Barbie can put on each table, we need to divide the total number of dolls by the number of tables. So, we can write the equation as:

   Number of dolls per table = Total dolls / Number of tables

4. Now, let's plug in the values from step 2 into the equation:

   Number of dolls per table = 7 / 2

5. To calculate the result, we need to divide 7 by 2:

   Number of dolls per table = 3.5 (since we can't put half a doll on a table, we can round this number to the nearest whole number, which is 4)
Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 1. We need to find out how many Battle Passes each player has unlocked and their experience points.

Step 1: Assign variables
Let T represent the number of players, B represent the number of Battle Passes each player unlocked, and E represent the number of experience points each player earned.

Step 2: Write the equations for each player
For each player, they have 11 levels with 25 points needed per level, so they need 275 experience points. Their Battle Passes give them a 50% boost to their experience points. We can represent this as an equation:

E = 0.5 * B

Step 3: Write the equation for the total number of Battle Passes unlocked
Let T be the total number of players. Then, the total number of Battle Passes unlocked is:

B_total = T * B

Step 4: Write the equation for the total experience points earned
The total experience points earned is:

E_total = T * E = T * (0.5 * B_total) = 0.5 * T * B_total

Topic: Steph Curry ### Response: 1. First, we need to define the variables for our problem. Let's define:
   - n as the number of total shots attempted by Steph Curry
   - x as the number of successful shots
   - p as the probability of success (percentage)

2. We know that the probability of success is given as a percentage, so we need to convert it into decimal form to work with it. To do this, we can divide the percentage by 100:

   p = (probability of success) % / 100

   For example, if the probability of success is 50%, then p = 0.5.

3. Now, we can use the binomial probability formula to find the number of successful shots (x) given the number of total shots attempted (n), the probability of success (p), and the binomial coefficient:

   C(n, x) = n! / (x! * (n - x)!)

   where ! denotes the factorial (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1

Problem: There are 50 dinosaur species in the park. Among them, 40 species are herbivores, and the rest are carnivores. If we want to know how many carnivore species there are, we need to subtract the number of herbivores from the total number of dinosaurs in the park.

2. Define the problem in Python as a function:

def solution():
    #The total number of dinosaur species in the park is 50.
    total_species = 50
    #The number of herbivore species is 40.
    herbivores = 40
    #To find the number of carnivore species, we need to subtract the number of herbivores from the total number of dinosaurs in the park.
    carnivores = total_species - herbivores
    #The answer is: We need to find the number of carnivore species, which is the difference between the total number of dinosaur species and the number of herb

3. Define the function:
We want to find the number of cars that are not red, blue, black, silver, or green. We can use a function called `solution()` to do this.
4. Write the logic for the function:
- First, we need to find the total number of cars that are red, blue, black, silver, or green. We can do this by adding the number of cars of each color together.
  - Total cars of these colors = (Number of red cars) + (Number of blue cars) + (Number of black cars) + (Number of silver cars) + (Number of green cars)
  
- Now, we want to find the number of cars that are not one of these colors. We can do this by subtracting the total number of cars of these colors
Topic: cheer leading ### Response: 1. First, we need to understand the problem: We need to find the number of cheerleaders in a cheerleading squad who have blue eyes.

2. We are given the following information:
   a. There are 12 cheerleaders in the squad.
   b. Out of these 12, one cheerleader has brown eyes.
   c. Another three cheerleaders have green eyes.

3. Now, let's think step by step.
   a. We know that one cheerleader has brown eyes, and three cheerleaders have green eyes.
   b. So, we can add these two numbers together: 1 cheerleader (with brown eyes) + 3 cheerleaders (with green eyes) = 4 cheerleaders in total have either brown or green eyes.
   c. We are not interested in these 4 cheerleaders, but in the ones with blue eyes. So, let's subtract the number of cheerleaders with brown or green eyes from the total number of cheerleaders in the squad.
   d. The total number of cheerleaders in the squad is 12.
Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 1. Let's say there are two players playing Fortnite, Player A and Player B. Player A has 150 gold, while Player B has 200 gold. 
2. In one game, Player A wins 10 gold from Player B.
3. After the game, we need to calculate the new amounts of gold for both players. 
4. To do this, we subtract the 10 gold that Player A won from Player B's initial gold amount: 200 - 10 = 190 gold. So, Player B now has 190 gold.
5. At the same time, we add the 10 gold that Player A won to their initial gold amount: 150 + 10 = 160 gold. So, Player A now has 160 gold.
6. To summarize the solution, we can write a Python function that takes the initial gold amounts of Player A and Player B, and the amount of gold won by Player A, and returns the new gold amounts for both players:

Topic: cars ### Response: 1. Define the problem: Let's assume the number of cars produced in 2010 is x. We need to find the number of cars produced in 2011, which has increased by 15%.

2. Calculate the increase in the number of cars produced from 2010 to 2011: To find the increase, we need to multiply the number of cars produced in 2010 (x) by 15/100.
   Increase = 0.15 * x

3. Determine the number of cars produced in 2011: To find the number of cars produced in 2011, we need to add the increase (calculated in step 2) to the number of cars produced in 2010 (x).
   Cars produced in 2011 = x + Increase
   Cars produced in 2011 = x + 0.15 * x

Topic: soccer ### Response: 1. We need to find the total number of corners a soccer team has taken in a season. We know that the team takes:
  - 9 corners on average per game
  - 30 games in a season

2. First, we need to multiply the average number of corners (9) by the number of games (30) to find the total number of corners in a season:

   Total corners in a season = 9 corners/game * 30 games/season = 270 corners/season

3. Now, we know that the team has played 29 games so far and has taken:
  - 263 corners in total

4. To find the number of corners the team needs to take in the last game to reach the average, we need to subtract the total corners taken so far (263) from the total corners in a season (270):

   Corners needed in the last game = 270 corners/season - 263 corners/season = 7 corners/game

5. Therefore, the soccer team needs to take 7 corners in the last

Topic: cars ### Response: 30 cars are in a parking lot. 20 cars drive away, and 10 more cars arrive. How many cars are left in the parking lot?

Step 1: We begin with 30 cars in the parking lot.
Step 2: 20 cars drive away, so we subtract that number from the initial number of cars. 30 cars - 20 cars = 10 cars. Now there are 10 cars left in the parking lot.
Step 3: 10 more cars arrive, so we add that number to the current number of cars in the parking lot. 10 cars + 10 cars = 20 cars.

So, after 20 cars drive away and 10 more cars arrive, there are 20 cars left in the parking lot.

The answer is: after 20 cars drive away and 10 more cars arrive, there are 20 cars left in the parking lot.
Topic: field hockey ### Response: 

Step 1: Formulate the problem
In a field hockey tournament, a team participates in a specific number of matches. The team gets 3 points for each win, 1 point for each draw, and 0 points for each loss. We need to find the maximum number of points the team can earn.

Step 2: Identify the variables and constraints
Let N be the total number of matches played by the team. Since the team played all the matches, the sum of the points for wins, draws, and losses should be equal to N. We denote the number of matches won by W, the number of matches drawn by D, and the number of matches lost by L.

W + D + L = N

The team earns 3 points for each win, so the total points won by the team for wins is:

3W

The team earns 1 point for each draw, so the total points won by the team for draws is:

D

The team earns 0 points for each loss, so the total points won by the team for losses is:

5. Therefore, Serena Williams needs to win 1 more Grand Slam singles title to tie Steffi Graf's record. To break the record, she would need to win 2 more titles (1 to tie and 1 to break the record).
Topic: cars ### Response: 1. Define the problem: We need to find the number of cars that will cross the bridge in an hour.

Step 1: Find the number of seconds in an hour.
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Step 2: Calculate how many cars can cross the bridge per second.
2 cars can cross the bridge at the same time, and it takes 10 seconds for them to cross. Therefore, in 1 second, 1/10 of a car can cross the bridge.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars that can cross the bridge in 1 second.
Number of cars per second = (1/10) * 2 = 0.2 cars

Step 4: Calculate the number of cars that can cross the bridge in 1 hour.
Number of cars per hour = Cars per second * Seconds in an hour
Number of cars per hour = 0.2 cars/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 720 cars/

3. We also need to create a variable for the number of brown dogs. We'll call this variable Brown_Dogs and set it to an unknown value too.

4. We know that the total number of dogs (Total_Dogs) is the sum of the black dogs (Black_Dogs), brown dogs (Brown_Dogs), and dogs of other colors. So, we can write an equation to represent this relationship:

   - Total_Dogs = Black_Dogs + Brown_Dogs + Dogs_of_Other_Colors

5. Dogs_of_Other_Colors is not a variable we are solving for, so we can rewrite the equation as:

   - Total_Dogs
Topic: Harry Potter ### Response: 1) Malfoy stole 5 galleons from the Gryffindor tower. 2) Harry borrowed 10 galleons from Hagrid to pay for his firebolt. 3) Ron gave 20 galleons to the Weasley twins for their joke shop. 4) Hermione spent 40 galleons on books. 5) Harry won 30 galleons in a bet with Draco Malfoy. 6) They all spent 100 galleons in Hogsmeade. 

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of galleons they had before spending.
Total galleons = 5 galleons (stolen by Malfoy) + 10 galleons (borrowed by Harry) + 20 galleons (given by Ron) + 40 galleons (spent by Hermione) + 30 galleons (won by Harry) + 100 galleons (spent in Hogsmeade)

Topic: candy ### Response: 1. We need to set up our variables. We know that each candy costs 38 cents. We also know that the total cost of candies is $7.59, or 759 cents because we have 100 cents in a dollar. Our goal is to find the total number of candies, which we'll call "total_candies".

2. To find the total number of candies, we need to divide the total cost by the cost of each candy. Let's write this as an equation:

    total_cost = cost_per_candy * total_candies

3. Now, we can plug in the known values. The total cost is 759 cents, and the cost of each candy is 38 cents. So, we have:

    759 cents = 38 cents/candy * total_candies

4. To find the total number of candies, we need to solve for "total_candies". Let's first divide both sides of the equation by 38 cents/
Topic: Ninja Turtles ### Response:  Problem: 3 ninjas are in a room. Each ninja wears 2 masks. There are 2021 masks in the room. How many masks are not needed?

Solution:
def solution():
    #There are 3 ninjas in the room
    ninjas = 3
    #Each ninja wears 2 masks
    masks_per_ninja = 2
    #The answer is
    result = (ninjas * masks_per_ninja) - 2021
    return result
First, we need to find out how many masks the ninjas are wearing in total. To do this, we multiply the number of ninjas (3) by the number of masks each ninja wears (2):

ninjas * masks_per_ninja = 3 * 2 = 6

So, the ninjas are wearing a total of 6 masks. Now, we know that there are 2021 masks in the room. To find out how many masks are not needed, we subtract

Topic: football ### Response: 1. Gather the given information. 
The information given is as follows:

Step 1: Gather the total number of yards to get a first down, which is 10 yards.
We need to find out how many yards are needed to get a first down. According to the rules of football, a team needs to gain 10 yards in 4 downs to get a first down.

Step 2: Analyze the scenario.
Let's assume that the offense has already gained 5 yards in the first down. This means they need an additional 5 yards to reach the 10-yard mark for a first down.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining yards needed for a first down.
Since the offense has already gained 5 yards, we need to subtract this from the total yards required for a first down. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:
Remaining yards for a first down = Total yards needed for a first down - Yards already gained
Remaining yards for a first down = 10 - 5

Step 4: Solve the equation.
Remaining yards
Topic: Captain Marvel ### Response: 1. We need to find the total number of Zerg in the universe. The information given is:

   - Total number of Zerg in the universe = 1,000,000

2. To find the number of Zerg in each sector, we need to divide the total number of Zerg by the number of sectors.

   - Number of Zerg in each sector = Total number of Zerg / Number of sectors
   - Number of Zerg in each sector = 1,000,000 / 1,000
   - Number of Zerg in each sector = 1,000

So, there are 1,000 Zerg in each sector. The detailed answer is:

The number of Zerg in each sector is 1,000.

The answer is: the number of Zerg in each sector is 1,000.

Topic: Naruto ### Response: 1. First problem: Let's think about the first problem. If each Naruto series has 20 episodes, and Boruto has 20 series, how many episodes are there in total?

2. To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of episodes in each series (20) by the number of series (20).

3. So, the calculation would be: 20 episodes/series * 20 series = 400 episodes.

4. Therefore, the total number of episodes in Naruto is 400.

5. Second problem: Now, let's move on to the second problem. Let's say you have 88 episodes left to watch. If you watch 2 episodes a day, how many days will it take to finish all the episodes?

6. To find out, we need to divide the total number of episodes left to watch (88) by the number of episodes you watch each day (2).

7. So, the calculation would be: 88 episodes / 2 episodes/day = 44 days.

8. Therefore, it will take
Topic: planes ### Response: 1. Let's define the variables we need for the problem. Let x be the number of planes.
2. Each plane produces 50 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hour. So, the total amount of carbon dioxide produced by x planes in an hour is 50x tonnes. We can write this as an equation: Carbon Dioxide = 50x.
3. We want to find the value of x that produces 525 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hour. So, we need to solve the equation: 50x = 525.
4. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 50. This gives us: x = 525 / 50.
5. Now, we can perform the division: x = 10.5.
6. Since we can't have a fraction of a plane, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which gives us x = 11.
7. So, 11 planes produce 525 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hour.

Topic: Pokémon ### Response: 

Step 1: Understand the problem
We have a Pokémon trainer who needs to travel from city A to city B. They have a total of 50 Pokémon with different levels of power (P) and speed (S). We need to find a certain combination of Pokémon that allows the trainer to reach city B as quickly as possible.

Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the number of Pokémon with power P and speed S as x and y, respectively. We know that x + y = 50, as the trainer has a total of 50 Pokémon.

Step 3: Identify the goal
The goal is to maximize the combined power and speed of the Pokémon. We can represent this as a function of x and y:

F(x, y) = P(x) * S(y)

Since we have the constraint x + y = 50, we can rewrite F(x, y) as:

F(x) = P(x) * S(50 - x)

Step 4: Define the functions

Topic: Harry Potter ### Response: 1. First, we need to understand the Harry Potter themed problem. 

2. The problem states that Weasley and Malfoy are given a test to multiply the squares of two numbers: a and b. Their scores are calculated by:

   Score = (a^2 * b^2) / (a + b)

   The answer is: The goal of the question asks us to find the maximum possible score. 

3. To maximize the score, we need to find the maximum of the expression (f(a) * f(b)) subject to a+b = constant. Since f(x) = x^2, we want to maximize (f(a) * f(b)) = (a^2 * b^2) subject to a+b = constant.

4. Notice that when a = b, we have f(a) = f(b), thus the maximum is achieved when a=b. Since a+b = constant, we want to find the constant that gives us the highest product of a^2 * b^2.

Topic: cats ### Response: 1. Let's define the variables for the given word problem:
   - Number of cats: C
   - Number of days: D
   - Number of cats born each day: B

2. We need to find the total number of cats after D days. Since the number of cats increases by B each day, we can represent the total number of cats after D days as a geometric series:

   C + C*B + C*B^2 + ... + C*B^(D-1)

3. Now, let's find the sum of this geometric series. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

   Sum = (a * (1 - r^n)) / (1 - r)

   where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

4. In our case, the first term (a) is C, the common ratio (r) is B, and the number of terms (n) is D. So, we have:

Topic: dinosaurs ### Response: 15-foot-tall dinosaurs are coming, but not in a straight line. We need to calculate the distance they will travel. 

Step 1: Calculate the height of the dinosaur
The height of the dinosaur is given as 15 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the distance the dinosaur travels in one step
Since the dinosaur is moving at an angle, it will travel a diagonal distance in one step. To calculate this distance, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, where the height of the dinosaur (15 feet) is one leg of the right triangle, and the horizontal distance is the other leg.

Let's assume the horizontal distance is x feet. Then, the diagonal distance the dinosaur travels in one step can be calculated as:

Diagonal distance = √(15^2 + x^2)

Step 3: Calculate the total distance the dinosaur will travel
Since the dinosaur is moving in a zigzag pattern, we need to multiply the diagonal distance by the number of steps. Let's assume

The coach of a volleyball team has 18 players, and each player can play as a setter, hitter, or blocker. Each player must choose exactly one of these three roles. The coach wants to find the number of possible combinations of role assignments for the team. We need to create a word problem and a Python function to find the solution.

2. List all possible role assignments for each player:
We have 18 players and 3 roles (setter, hitter, blocker), so each player can choose one of the 3 roles. 

3. Calculate the total number of possible combinations:
Since each player has 3 choices, we can find the total number of combinations by multiplying the number of choices for each player: 

Total combinations = (Number of choices for each player) ^ (Number of players)
Total combinations = 3 ^ 18

4. Use the Python function to find the value of the total combinations:
We can use the Python function to calculate the value of 3 ^ 18:

Topic: pizza ### Response: 1. First, we need to understand the problem. We are given that a pizza is divided into 8 slices. 5 such pizzas are ordered, and we need to find out the total number of slices. 2. We start by performing the multiplication of the number of slices per pizza and the number of pizzas. This is because for each pizza, we have 8 slices, and since there are 5 pizzas, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the total number of slices. 3. So, the multiplication operation in this case is 8 (slices per pizza) times 5 (number of pizzas), which equals 40. 4. Therefore, the total number of slices in those 5 pizzas is 40. 

Here's the code:

def find_total_slices(slices_per_pizza, number_of_pizzas):
    return slices_per_pizza * number_of_pizzas

In the code, we define a function called `find_total_slices`. This function takes

Topic: Thor, the God of Thunder ### Response: 1. Start with a problem statement: Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, has a maximum power of 100 megawatts (MW). To fully charge Mjolnir, Thor needs to spend 1,000 seconds. How long will it take for Thor to charge the hammer if he has 50 MW of power?

2. First, we need to understand the relationship between energy and power. Energy is the capacity to do work, while power is the rate at which work is done. In this case, we are given the maximum power (100 MW) and the time it takes to fully charge the hammer (1,000 seconds). We can use this information to calculate the total energy required to fully charge the hammer.

3. The formula to calculate energy is:

   Energy = Power × Time

   In this case:
   - Power = 100 MW
   - Time = 1,000 seconds

4. Plug the values into the formula:

   Energy = (100 MW) × (1,000

Topic: Black Panther ### Response: 1. We need to find the population of Wakanda in 2018. We know the population growth rate is 3% per year.
2. The population of Wakanda in 2010 was 21,000,000.
3. To find the population in 2018, we need to calculate the population growth for 8 years (2018 - 2010 = 8 years).
4. The population growth per year is 3%, so the total population growth for 8 years is (3/100) * 8 = 0.24.
5. Now, we need to add the total population growth to the initial population to find the population in 2018.
6. The initial population is 21,000,000, so the population in 2018 is 21,000,000 * (1 + 0.24) = 26,240,000.
7. Therefore, the population of Wakanda in 2018 is
Topic: field hockey ### Response: 1. We start by defining the total number of players on the field hockey team as 11.
2. The team has 2 goalies, 3 defenders, and 5 midfielders.
3. Now, we need to find out how many players are forwards.
4. We do this by subtracting the number of goalies, defenders, and midfielders from the total number of players.
5. So, the number of forwards is the total number of players minus the number of goalies, defenders, and midfielders: 11 (total players) - 2 (goalies) - 3 (defenders) - 5 (midfielders) = 1 remaining player.
6. Therefore, there is 1 player who is a forward.

The answer is: there are 1 players that are forwards.
Topic: unicorns ### Response: 1. We have a number of unicorns. Let's represent this number as 'x'.
2. We know that unicorns can only be found in groups of 3, 5, or 7. We will represent these groups as 'y', 'z', and 'w'. So, 'x' can be expressed as '3y', '5z', '7w', or any combination of these.
3. We want to express 'x' in terms of 'y', 'z', and 'w'. To do this, we can use the following equations:
   - x = 3y (representing unicorns in groups of 3)
   - x = 5z (representing unicorns in groups of 5)
   - x = 7w (representing unicorns in groups of 7)
4. To find the total number of unicorns (x), we can add the number of unicorns in each group:
   x = 3y + 5z + 7w
5. Now, we need to find the minimum value of

Topic: Captain America ### Response: 1. First, we need to define the problem: Captain America wants to buy 600 movie tickets. Each ticket costs $10.

2. To find the total cost of the movie tickets, we need to multiply the number of tickets by the cost of each ticket:

Total cost = Number of tickets * Cost per ticket
Total cost = 600 * $10 = $6000

3. Now, Captain America knows that he can get a discount of $0.50 per ticket if he buys more than 500 tickets. To find out how many tickets he needs to buy to get the discount, we need to divide the number of tickets he wants to buy by the number of tickets required for the discount:

Number of tickets required for discount = 600 tickets / 500 tickets = 1.2 (rounded up)

4. Since Captain America wants to buy 600 tickets, he needs to buy at least 1200 tickets (1.2 * 1000 tickets) to

To find how many albums she sold in the US and the rest of the world combined, we need to add the albums sold in the US to the albums sold in the rest of the world. So, we have:

Albums sold in the US = 150 million
Albums sold in the rest of the world = 20 million

2. Approach: To find the total number of albums sold in the US and the rest of the world combined, we need to add the number of albums sold in the US to the number of albums sold in the rest of the world. 

Step 1: Add the two values:
   150 million (albums sold in the US) + 20 million (albums sold in the rest of the world) = 170 million (total albums sold)

Topic: soccer ### Response: 1. The problem: Cristiano Ronaldo scores 1.06 goals per game on average. In the last game, he scored 2 goals. Now, Ronaldo is set to play 2 more games.

2. The average number of goals that Ronaldo scores per game is 1.06. Therefore, on average, we expect him to score 1.06 goals in the next game.

3. We want to find out how many goals Ronaldo will score in the next two games. Since he is playing two games, we need to multiply the average number of goals he scores per game by 2. 

4. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of goals Ronaldo will score in the next two games by performing the following calculation:

   Number of goals in 2 games = 1.06 * 2

5. After performing the calculation, we find that Ronaldo is expected to score 2.12 goals in the next two games.

6. Since Ronaldo has already scored 2 goals in the last game, we need to add these 2 goals to the expected goals

   - A = the number of cheese pizzas ordered
   - B = the number of pepperoni pizzas ordered
   - C = the number of veggie pizzas ordered
   - D = the total number of pizzas ordered

2. Next, we need to establish the relationship between the variables. Since each pizza has a unique type, the total number of pizzas (D) is equal to the sum of the number of cheese pizzas (A), pepperoni pizzas (B), and veggie pizzas (C). We can write this as an equation:

   D = A + B + C

3. Now, we need to find the value of D. We know that there are 25 pizzas in total, so:

   D = 25

4. We can now solve the equation for one of the variables. Let's find the value of A (cheese pizzas):

   A = D - B - C

2. To do this, we need to calculate the number of games she won in each grand slam event.
3. First, let's calculate the number of games she won at the Australian Open:
   - She won the Australian Open 7 times.
   - Each grand slam event consists of 7 rounds.
   - To win the Australian Open, she would have to win 7 rounds x 3 sets per round = 21 sets.
   - Each set consists of 6 games. So, she would have won 21 sets x 6 games per set = 126 games.

4. Now, let's calculate the number of games she won at the French Open:
   - She won the French Open 3 times.
   - Each time she won, she would have played 7 rounds x 3 sets per round = 21 sets.
   - Each set consists of 6 games. So, she would have won 21 sets x 6 games per set = 126 games
Topic: Ninja Turtles ### Response: 600 cases of pizza are to be shipped to 4 cities. Each city gets 1/3 of the total cases of pizza (600 cases / 4 cities = 1 / 3 cases per city). 

Step 1: First, we need to calculate the total number of cases of pizza that each city gets. We know that each city gets 1/3 of the total cases of pizza. So, we multiply the total cases of pizza (600) by 1/3. This gives us:

600 cases * 1/3 = 200 cases

So, each city gets 200 cases of pizza.

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many cases of pizza each Ninja Turtle receives since they split the pizza equally among them. We know that there are 6 Ninja Turtles (Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones). So, we divide the total number of cases of pizza that each city gets (200) by
Topic: volleyball ### Response: 

Question: Maria is 15 years old and wants to try out for the high school volleyball team. She needs to be at least 16 years old to be eligible. How many more months does she need to wait until she can try out?

Solution:First, we need to determine how much older Maria needs to be to be eligible for the tryouts. Since the minimum age requirement is 16 years old, and Maria is currently 15 years old, we can calculate the difference in years:

16 years (minimum age) - 15 years (Maria's current age) = 1 year

Now, let's find out how many months are in a year:

1 year = 12 months

Since Maria needs to wait for 1 more year to be eligible, she will need to wait for:

1 year * 12 months/year = 12 months

So, Maria has to wait 12 more months until she can try out for the high school volleyball team.

The answer is: she needs to wait 1 more year

   - Tippy is a cat, but not a twin of Hello Kitty or Mimmy because he is a tabby cat.
3. We need to calculate the number of twins. To do this, we will add the number of boys and girls that are twins:
   - Hello Kitty is a girl, so we have 1 girl twin.
   - Mimmy is a boy, so we have 1 boy twin.
   Therefore, we have 1 + 1 = 2 twins in total.
4. We need to calculate the number of friends who are not twins. To do this, we will subtract the number of twins from the total number of friends:
   - There are 3 friends in total (Hello Kitty,

We want to find the total points scored by both teams after a certain number of matches.

2. Step 2: Define the variables
Let's denote the number of matches as 'n', the number of goals scored per match by Team A as 'a', and the number of goals scored per match by Team B as 'b'. We want to find the total points scored by both teams, which is the sum of the points scored by Team A and Team B in all the matches played.

3. Step 3: Set up the formula
The total points scored by both teams can be calculated using the formula:

Total points = (a + b) * n

4. Step 4: Explain the formula
The formula calculates the total points scored by both teams. The term 'a + b' represents the total number of goals scored in a single match by both teams. This is then multiplied by 'n', the number of matches played, to give the total points scored by both teams.

Topic: basketball ### Response: 5 players are on a basketball team. Each player has a different number of points scored:
1. Player 1: 20 points
2. Player 2: 15 points
3. Player 3: 10 points
4. Player 4: 8 points
5. Player 5: 5 points
The task is to find the total points scored by the team.

The answer is: Total points scored by the team is the sum of the points scored by each player. We can find the total points by adding the points scored by each player:
Total points = Player 1 points + Player 2 points + Player 3 points + Player 4 points + Player 5 points
Total points = 20 + 15 + 10 + 8 + 5 = 58 points
So, the total points scored by the team is 58 points.

Two trains are traveling towards each other on the same track. Train A is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and Train B is traveling at a speed of 80 miles per hour. If they are 200 miles apart, how long will it take for them to collide?

2. Encapsulate the problem into a Python function:

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for time, which is distance / speed. In this case, we have two trains with different speeds, so we need to find the average speed of the two trains.

def train_collide(train_a_speed, train_b_speed, distance):
   
3. Calculate the average speed for both trains:

   average_speed = (train_a_speed + train_b_speed) / 2

Topic: cars ### Response: 1. First, we need to define the variables for the problem. Let's say:
   - B is the number of blue cars
   - R is the number of red cars
   - Y is the number of yellow cars
   - W is the number of white cars
   - All cars are either blue, red, yellow, or white.
   - The total number of cars is 32 (B + R + Y + W = 32)

2. Now, let's assume that there are 6 red cars and 10 yellow cars. We can represent this as:
   - R = 6
   - Y = 10

3. Since all cars are either blue, red, yellow, or white, and we know the number of red and yellow cars, we can find the number of blue and white cars by subtracting the number of red and yellow cars from the total number of cars:
   - B + W = 32 - 6 - 10 = 16

4. Now, we need to find the number of blue cars. We know that there are twice as many blue cars as white
Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 1. Write down the problem statement: In Fortnite, a player can find 10 different types of weapons. If a player finds 2 of each type, how many weapons will the player have in total?
2. First, we need to calculate the total number of weapons the player will find. Since there are 10 different types of weapons and the player finds 2 of each type, we multiply 10 (types) by 2 (each). So, 10 * 2 = 20 weapons.
3. Now, we have the total number of weapons, which is 20. However, we need to consider that the player can also pick up 5 additional weapons during a match. So, we add these 5 weapons to the 20 weapons the player already has (20 + 5 = 25 weapons).
4. Finally, we need to calculate the total number of weapons the player will have after collecting all 20 types of weapons and picking up 5 additional weapons. So, we add the 20 weapons from the collection and the 5 additional weapons (20 + 5 = 25 weapons).

Step 1: Identify the number of scoops for each flavor:
- Chocolate: 6 scoops
- Vanilla: 5 scoops
- Strawberry: 3 scoops
- Mint: 4 scoops

Step 2: Determine the number of small cones required:
We need to fit 2 scoops of any flavor into a small cone. So, we can divide the total scoops by 2 to find out the number of small cones needed.
Total scoops = 6 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 18 scoops

Topic: Fortnite ### Response: 100 players parachute onto the map. After some time, only 50 players remain. We need to find the number of players eliminated. 

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Let's define the total number of players as T (100 players in this case) and the number of players remaining as R (50 players in this case).

2. To find the number of players eliminated, we can subtract the number of players remaining from the total number of players.

   Number of players eliminated = T - R

3. Now, we can plug in the given values and calculate the number of players eliminated.

   Number of players eliminated = 100 - 50
   Number of players eliminated = 50

So, 50 players were eliminated from the game.

The rewritten answer is: 50 players were eliminated.
